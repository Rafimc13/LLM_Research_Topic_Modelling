        Hello my good model again. I would like you to classify the comment that I will provide you. 
        The comment is about a IMDB comments for movies.
        I would like you to classify this comment among 2 classes positive and negative. The classes are: 
        positive class: 0
        negative class: 1
        Please keep in mind that the comments are in English. Moreover I will give you some examples on how to decide
        the label of the comment.
        Example comment 1: 
        'This is what happens when a franchise gets lazy, and no one can think of a new twist to add. 
        Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" series? The first three were played as horror films, with genuine 
        scares (albeit predictable) that held true to the theme of the movie. Then they ran out of folks for the doll 
        to stalk, and decided to play it for laughs, with the next two being black comedies.....Well, that;s what 
        happened here, but I think it was not meant to be like that. Kind of like saying, "I WANTED to make 
        pancakes for dessert! I did this on purpose!" when your souffl√© accidentally fizzles flat. But the milk was 
        spilled, and it had some value in the theaters as a goof.When the floor ripped out from under the passenger 
        seats, I sort of expected the passengers to extend their legs through the hole, start running Flintstones-Style,
        to safely land the plane in the Alps. I did. It would have fit into the silly campy theme of the rest of the 
        show.Instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the film, what about the social 
        implausibilities? Like having George Kennedy's character react calmly to the news that his date was a whore? 
        Even back in 1979, a man would not easily accept the notion that he has just poured his heart out to a paid 
        companion. He supposedly felt he made a connection with a kindred spirit, who is subsequently shown to be a 
        mercenary sex-worker with a come-on line. Who WOULDN'T feel cheated by the experience? And yet he giggles, 
        and wraps his arms around his buddy's waist as they merrily stroll off. What a cheap wrap up of a sleazy scene.
        Ouch.I had an appetite for souffl√©, and got served insipid clich√© pancakes. And no, you did NOT do it on purpose!'
        Response 1: '1'
        Example comment 2:
        'The greatest Tarzan ever made! This movie is done in a way that no other Tarzan ever has come close in doing. 
        It has every thing in it that you would want in a Tarzan movie. No other Tarzan movie ever has or ever will 
        portray the character this well. I would say that if you have seen a Tarzan movie and liked it you should see 
        this one you will love it, and if you have never seen Tarzan you should see this one and forget the rest 
        of them.'
