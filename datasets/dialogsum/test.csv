#Person2#: Very much, it's much more fun than being home!
#Person1#: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business?
#Person2#: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?
#Person1#: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.
#Person2#: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand?
#Person1#: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.
#Person2#: Better to have buffet lunch?
#Person1#: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.
#Person2#: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.
#Person1#: Oh, that'll be fine.
#Person2#: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.
#Person1#: Free, fine, yes.
#Person2#: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?
#Person1#: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?
#Person2#: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?
#Person1#: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.

#Person2#: Do you have any experience using weights?

#Person2#: Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.

test_382_3,"#Person1#: Police in North London are treating as murder the death of a man thought to be in his forties whose body was found in a pedestrian subway in Neasden. The man leading the hunt is Detective Chief Superintendent John Day, who explains what they know of the man's movements in the early hours of this morning.
#Person2#: What we've learned is the fact that he left the Level One Club, which is a drinking club in Neasden Lane, about 1:30 a.m., and we're trying to account for movements up till 2:15 a. m., because it was about that time he was found by a member of the club, an employee. He was found in the underpass, the pedestrian way, under the North Circular Road. Death was due to multiple head injuries. We understand that there may have been two girls and a man who was drunk in close proximity to the entrance to the subway, who may have seen the man walking in that direction, or any attacker who may have been following him.
#Person1#: About what time would you think that they were there?
#Person2#: Just after half past one to a quarter past two.
#Person1#: Then in that case the gap you have is really quite short. It's only more or less half a hour or forty minutes.
#Person2#: In fact, yes, as short as that.
#Person1#: And how far away from the Neasden underpass was the drinking club?
#Person2#: Fifty meters.
#Person1#: And at the moment you know of no other people in the area whom you want to talk to, other than the drunken man and the two women who were seen with him or near him at some time?
#Person2#: Yes. The club closed at half past one and there may have been other people who left the club who went that way. We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.
#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.
#Person2#: No, not at this stage.
#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.","John Day is telling #Person1# what they've known of the dead man's movements in the early hours of the morning, and there may be three witnesses, two girls and a man, but he hasn't been able to identify more.",A murder
