#Person1#: My father used to work in China for some years. He often complained that he couldn't find a place for fun in the evening. Most people stayed at home and very few could be seen walking on the street at nine or ten o'clock.

#Person2#: He certainly comes with great credentials. I think he is just the man to get this company off and running.
#Person1#: The company he left in order to take this job probably regrets losing him.
#Person2#: I'm sure they do. He was the one who was supposed to assume the leadership of the company when the current president retires.
#Person1#: Do you know why he left that company?
#Person2#: Some people said he was impatient to become the CEO. Others said it was because he didn't have enough say in the company.
#Person1#: I've heard he had a lot of incentive to join our company. There is a rumor that he was given a million dollars as a bonus and an annual salary of a million dollars.
#Person2#: Yes, and he also will have an 18% share of any increase in the value of the company.
#Person1#: If the company does as well as many new high-tech companies have done recently, that could mean a lot of money in his pocket.
#Person2#: That's true. Our company hasn't started issuing stock yet. I feel certain with his leadership the stock will increase in value rapidly when it does go public.

#Person2#: I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.
#Person1#: Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a lot of stops?

#Person2#: There are websites that will figure out what coverage is right for you.
#Person1#: What did you end up buying?
#Person2#: Well, my car is very old, so I didn't worry so much about what it would cost to repair it. I did buy a lot of coverage for fixing someone else's car.

#Person2#: Yes. I drank 3 bottles of beer.
#Person1#: Were you drunk?
#Person2#: Yeah. It was a shame. I got tipsy and knocked a plate off the table. The plate broke into pieces.
#Person1#: Did you pay for the broken plate?
#Person2#: No. I paid only for my dinner but not for the plate.
#Person1#: Did you apologize?
#Person2#: No, I didn't. And the waiter just wouldn't let me go.
#Person1#: Why not?
#Person2#: He asked me to pay for the plate. I got mad and punched him.
#Person1#: How many times did you punch him?
#Person2#: 3 times.
#Person1#: Where did you punch him?
#Person2#: One in the mouth and the other two in the face.
#Person1#: Did he fight back?

hiddentest_18,"#Person1#: I read that your company is downsizing again. What will that mean for your job?
#Person2#: It means I'm out of a job. They have already given me a 'pink slip'.
#Person1#: That's bad news. This has happened to you before, hasn't it?
#Person2#: Yes. This will be the third time in five years and I'm ready to call it quits.
#Person1#: What do you mean? You're going to quit working?
#Person2#: No, I'll still be working, but not for a company. I'm going to be my own boss.
#Person1#: Doesn't that make you a little nervous? You won't have all the benefits that go with working for a company no retire and no health insurance.
#Person2#: That is the bad part of it, but I am really tired of being dependent on the whims of big business. It seems that it hasn't been all that secure for me.
#Person1#: What will you do?
#Person2#: I've had a couple of friends who have gone out on their own. They say it is the best thing that ever happened to them.
#Person1#: I know it is the secret dream of a lot of people to be their own boss, especially the younger generation.
#Person2#: One of my friends just takes temporary jobs. Companies are looking for people with his skills, but only on a temporary basis. So he goes for one company to another, depending on where they need him. He's able to set his own working hours and he makes a lot more than he was when he was working full time. He really likes the freedom he enjoys.
#Person1#: What does he do when he doesn't have any jobs coming in?
#Person2#: He goes to a temporary employment agency. It seems he always finds work and doubles what he used to make.
#Person1#: I hope you find just the right thing for your skills. It would be nice to have a job that gave you more freedom.
#Person2#: That's why I'm making the change. I want to be able to spend the extra time with my family and it will be great to be working at my home instead of going to the office every day.

#Person1#: The key issue is to make sure that the packing is seaworthy. Of the last goods we received, there were a few items damaged by dampness.

#Person2#: Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and still stay dry.
#Person1#: What else could we do in bad weather?
#Person2#: You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses and buildings.
#Person1#: That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.
#Person2#: There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.

hiddentest_24,"#Person1#: It seems there are a growing number of new companies in the field of computers who are headed by very young people. Many of them are only in their twenties and already heading up highly successful companies.
#Person2#: That's true and I think you'll find their style of management to be very different from the traditional type of leadership.
#Person1#: I think they are more invokes in their companies. They run them as they would run a family. I believe they are more interested in their business and what it will be able to achieve for the good of the world. They don't seem to be as interested in the business as just a way to become rich as their older counterparts are.
#Person2#: Can you give me some example of their different leadership style?
#Person1#: Sure, how about this: Young bosses sometimes let their employees bring their children to work, even their pets? Many times they make decisions on the basis of what will be best for their employees instead of what is best for the business.
#Person2#: I guess young people are more idealistic, so when they have the drive and talent to start a business of their own, they also feel free to manage the business in ways that they believe are ethical and moral.
#Person1#: Do you think these young businessmen and businesswomen are more ethical and moral than business owners and managers in past generations?
#Person2#: Yes, I really do. I think businesses in the past haven't been concerned about their employees' personal needs. I think young owners have heard their parents complain about their working situations as they were growing up. Now that they can do things the way they want, they want to change things for the better.
#Person1#: Right now these young businessmen and businesswomen are making a lot of money, so it is easy for them to demonstrate their lofty ideals. Do you think they will remain true to those ideals during economic hard times?

#Person1#: If this continues, I would speak to the manager.",complaint
hiddentest_99,"#Person1#: I can help you. Do you have a down payment?
#Person2#: Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.
#Person1#: Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car.
#Person2#: I don't know where exactly to get a loan.
#Person1#: Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.
#Person2#: What is the best choice for financing?
#Person1#: It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.
#Person2#: What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?
#Person1#: You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good luck!",loan
