Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and Jack Sargeant. Vikki Howells is substituting for Jack Sargeant. So, Vikki, welcome; it's good to see you in the committee. Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. So thank you all for attending this afternoon. We're really looking forward to hearing your views on the Bill. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Perfectly happy."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment\u2014how does that protect children."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. That is a defence that is available for assault upon a child. By way of contrast, it is not available for an offence involving an adult. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form\u2014that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that. We don't need to go back a very long way to find, for example, that there was no such offence as raping one's married wife, and the law has changed to reflect the fact that that is simply not acceptable. And from what I've seen of the research, and I think back to the 2007 review, to which you've just referred, there is evidence within that review already that opinions are changing. And I've seen research more current than that that suggests that young people find it less acceptable to use reasonable punishment in chastising a child than do people of an older generation. Of course, as we move forward in time, the people who are young now are going to be the older adults of the future. So one would hope that the law will change to reflect the way in which people behave within society."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We have heard evidence as a committee that this proposed law would provide a much clearer legal framework\u2014that is, to take out this reasonable punishment defence, that then would make things much clearer for parents and professionals. Does the CPS have a view on that?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I think it will make things clearer. I'm not sure it will make them much clearer, because if we get into some of the\u2014. It may be helpful to look at some examples at some stage. And when it comes to prosecuting, it's often the case that things aren't just black and white; there are multiple shades of grey in between. We know that the Children Act did introduce a degree of clarity, in that it removed the defence of reasonable chastisement for offences of causing actual bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm, causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and various incidents of child cruelty under the Children and Young Persons Act. In that sense, matters were clarified, because up until that point it was not entirely clear. There were a series of Court of Appeal cases that sought to clarify the law, but that was at a time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. And the Children Act was brought in to reflect the direction that the case law was moving in. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. So, there was a decision made back then that it was appropriate to do that. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children\u2014some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. And removing that defence does make life clearer."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "What are the areas of grey that you refer to? Can you give a few examples?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "If you take an example\u2014so, one of the examples that I've heard discussed has been a child\u2014a young child; let's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road\u2014who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic. The parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back. Now, technically, taking hold of the child at that point is an assault, because it's an unwanted imposition of physical force. But no-one's going to say that's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts. Of course, that would be utter nonsense. There's no hostility; it's simply taking hold of a child to protect them. At that point, the parent then seeks to admonish the child, tells them off and smacks the child on the legs. Now, that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement. Probably. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. So, that, I would say, sits at one end of the spectrum. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. So, there is a spectrum of offending. Towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. We would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court. That would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that I've just described to you. Does that help to illustrate that, at one end, it's relatively white and the other end it's relatively black, but in the middle we have the shades of grey?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end. Because if you're removing this\u2014we'll probably come on to that."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Shall I address that in terms\u2014? Okay. So, you are probably aware, but forgive me if I just explain quickly anyway, when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for Crown prosecutors, which has a two-stage test. The first stage is whether there's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and the second stage is\u2014. And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case\u2014the light smacking on the leg\u2014at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think\u2014and I think this is what will probably happen in practice\u2014that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is\u2014it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. So, it may be referred to the CPS for a charging decision. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thanks."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Hello. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this\u2014and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing\u2014that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public. The second example that I'll give you is that we already have within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws, and the example I'll give to you is this: drink driving. In England and Wales, the limit for having micrograms of alcohol in your breath is 35 \u00b5g in 100 ml of breath. Across the border in Scotland, it drops to 22 \u00b5g. So, the same act\u2014. As you drive into Scotland, you're probably okay to drive if you've got 34 \u00b5g; by the time you get into Scotland, you won't be. And the consequences for you are significant, because of course it's an offence in Scotland, and not an offence in England, but the punishment, namely disqualification, applies everywhere in the United Kingdom. So, we already have a degree of divergence of law, and the CPS recognises this. In our code, we have a specific provision that takes account of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups\u2014Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences\u2014and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And that would be primarily around the public interest issue."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "It would."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I understand. Okay. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "My own personal involvement?"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Or the service's."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis. I met with a Minister and a Deputy Minister\u2014I met with Huw Irranca-Davies a little while ago, and I met with Julie Morgan a few months ago\u2014to discuss the overall implications, and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other. It hasn't been a very close-knit involvement, but we have had enough involvement so that we've felt we've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. So you've been satisfied with the level of involvement that you've had."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes. I don't feel that it's been too much, nor do I feel we've been left on the side at all."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Now, we've just talked about the divergence of criminal law, and this is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales\u2014well, and in England, actually, across the border\u2014will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "But you would expect that to be something you would\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I've got a supplementary from Suzy, and then Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in\u2014. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right\u2014obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers\u00a0of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with Kwame, who would have an involvement in this. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. So, it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. But thank you, anyway; I take your point."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "My point is about the criminal law in Wales and England diverging in this particular instance, and we've been told that this is probably the first time it's happened. Can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "There are other offences in Wales that don't exist in England, but they don't crop up very often. So, to give you examples, there is an offence of putting an electronic collar on your pet\u2014let's not stretch that into children. [Laughter.] But, you know, sometimes\u2014I'll be quiet. But putting an electronic collar on your pet that administers a shock is an offence in Wales; it's not an offence in England. There are also offences around the picking of cockles in west Wales, which is not an offence\u2014. So, you can see there are some, but I would argue that the fact that you drive across the border into Scotland and commit an offence that you won't commit in England is possibly more significant for the general public. Of course, the topic we're discussing here is of real relevance for the general public, and you have heard evidence, I know, already, that comes from people who are quite strongly in favour and people quite strongly against it. One of the ways in which I've approached this is looking at it from the perspective of what the law is there for, which is to set out, in essence, what is acceptable, what is not acceptable. It doesn't necessarily mean we need to use the law for that, but it signifies how society views a certain behaviour. I like to look at it from the perspective of the person who is being affected by this, namely the child, and the change in the law here would afford children a degree of protection that they don't presently have, but which they do have when they attain the age of 16.FootnoteLink So, I looked at this\u2014. If I can give you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying\u2014but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. That seems to me to not necessarily fit with where we ought to be as a society."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment\u2014who knows? Not tomorrow, I'd say."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some specific questions around implementation now from Suzy Davies."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. Can I just begin by asking you to help the committee out here in understanding how the burden of proof is going to work if this defence is removed? Because the issue of whether something is punishment or not is going to disappear, providing that it's clear that contact with a child has happened. Is that going to work on the presumption that that's an unlawful contact? Is that something the prosecution will still have to prove, or will it be for an accused parent to say, to use your example, 'I was just dragging them out of the traffic or stopping them putting their hands in the fire'?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I understand your point. There's no change whatsoever to the burden of proof, nor to the standard of proof."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Perhaps you can run us through it quickly."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "If the defence argue that that act was\u2014. So, we have to show that there's been an unlawful assault. So, if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement, in a sense that alters some things but it doesn't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution, which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And if the defence raise an argument and say, 'Well, look, that was a lawful act; I was only doing what I thought was reasonable in the circumstances', it's for the Crown to disprove that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. That's great."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "And we've got to disprove that to the criminal standard, which is beyond a reasonable doubt. So, you can certainly see\u2014. I can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter, to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial, and it would be our responsibility to disprove that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. That's really helpful for us to understand that. Obviously, when we're talking about CPS guidelines and all the rest, we've already come some distance down the process, haven't we? Have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest? Because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you're arrested, that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like DBS checks in the future, even if it goes no further. Do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on, even at the point of the knock at the door?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "From the perspective of the CPS, I'm not sure I can help you there."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's fine. I was expecting that answer."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Simply because that's a matter for the police. Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate\u2014. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. We can't direct the police."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes\u2014if it does\u2014for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. I think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward. We need involvement\u2014Iwan, for example, and the strategic implementation group. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we can liaise, in turn, with Kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop. So, I think we've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose\u2014at least, 'adequate' might sound a little\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Sufficient."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes, perfectly sufficient."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, you're confident, by 2022, then, that you'll have changes to the CPS guidelines that are good to go, if you like."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Fit for purpose, yes."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Okay, that's great. Bear with me a second\u2014thank you very much\u2014in your written evidence, you did welcome the indication from the Welsh Government that this reasonable period after Royal Assent would be necessary. Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will\u2014. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. But this would be a very specific flag for assault on a child\u2014reasonable chastisement. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales\u2014it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. So, we would keep a manual log of every referral. That would be unmanageable if we were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, you're not anticipating hundreds and hundreds."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Not at all. Not at all. My take on it: I've seen and spoken with Matt Jukes about this, from South Wales Police; I have seen the justice impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers\u2014and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution\u2014it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever\u201412, 18 months, maybe 24 months\u2014where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. We do this already with certain types of offences. We have what we call local scrutiny involvement panels. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which I mean people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. We'd bring them in and look through the cases. So, we open our books, show them our cases, and we have a very frank discussion. We involve the police in that as well. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example\u2014the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, that's really helpful, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Before we move on, can I just ask\u2014? The Children Act 2004 applies to a child up to the age of 18\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Sixteen."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You mentioned 16; that's what I wanted to clarify. Our understanding was that it went up to 18."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which\u2014I give credit to Iwan for this, because he thought of it. If we take an adult with a small child\u2014say, a four-year-old\u2014in a supermarket, and the child is pulling cans off the shelves, it's quite annoying, and they keep doing it and keep doing it. The parent remonstrates, and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate, and smacks the child lightly on the legs, which does the trick and the child stops. Presently, if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police, I think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement. In other words, the evidential stage wouldn't be passed; you don't get on to consider the public interest. But if we have that same parent in there the following week, and you have the same happen again, presently, the defence would apply. Now, there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Thank you, that's really useful, and\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are\u2014. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a supplementary on that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. In the same session this morning I thought this was an interesting question raised by a parent, on the rights of the child side of things, where if a parent offers a child two forms of punishment because that child has done something that they know they shouldn't have, and they're given the option of, 'You can have a quick smack and a cwtch, or you're going to your bedroom for quarter of an hour', and the child is allowed to choose and the child chooses the smack, what happens then? I'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given, but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "That's a really interesting question. There is a body of law that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "A child can't consent to assault."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes, you can't consent to a serious assault, apart from in certain\u2014. The law is really quite difficult. So, for example, tattooing is a serious assault on one level, but you can consent to a tattoo. I can think of one case where a man branded his initials on a woman's buttocks, but she consented to it and the Court of Appeal held that they could consent to that. I can also think of a series of cases, which I won't get into here, that involve sadomasochistic behaviour between adults, some of which was really serious, and involved people willingly applying themselves to things that no sane person would do. And the Court of Appeal in that case, a case called Brown, said, 'No, that's going too far\u2014you can't consent to that.' Then, you may have seen there was a case from the midlands recently where a gentleman operating a tattoo parlour was also involved in body surgery\u2014splitting people's tongues. That went too far as well. So, there is again\u2014I referred before to the spectrum of offending, and there is a clear spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth. I'm still not entirely clear, and I speak as a lawyer. When it comes to much lesser assaults, the law is more unclear as to what you can consent to."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, because we're talking below a certain standard here as well. Okay."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "As to what you can consent to, it's less clear. It would need to be developed."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you for that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Vikki."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something\u2014. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say\u2014for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth\u2014we\u00a0 think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering\u00a0the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility\u2014that will fall to the police\u2014but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?"}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "It does. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill\u2014how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved\u2014the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Somewhere within Wales\u2014Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question."}, {"speaker": "Vikki Howells AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here\u2014by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes\u2014if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something, which is potentially divisive, and I think you've probably seen some of that. Anything like that is a good story, and a good story gets out there, which means you're more likely to make people aware of it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, we've discussed some of these already, but, for example, under the new law, or the proposed law, would one unintended consequence be that, if someone living in Wales who can't use the reasonable punishment defence\u2014would their life prospects be different compared to those people in England, who will be able to use that defence? I think you've mentioned that in your written evidence."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes. Okay. A simple answer: if somebody in Wales is convicted\u2014so, if it goes towards the end of the spectrum that is serious, which results in a prosecution\u2014. It may be\u2014the sort of circumstance I can see happening here is somebody who takes a principled stand and declines any form of out-of-court disposal and says, 'Prosecute me'. We probably would end up prosecuting, because it's a relatively serious offence. So, let's say it comes to court and let's say they end up being convicted of assaulting their child\u2014in circumstances that would not have happened in England\u2014then they would have a criminal conviction they wouldn't have in England, and that, inevitably, has an impact upon their life prospects. But I think, along the road there, there would have been an element of choice."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And do you think that that would be an isolated incident?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes, truly, I believe, an isolated incident. I've said before that I would be very surprised if we even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales\u2014this was the review in 2007\u2014it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales\u2014and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally\u2014you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets\u2014it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "What about\u2014? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was\u2014much."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners\u2014whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses. Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen. And I can't think of anything else off the top of my head."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Finally from me, therefore\u2014another issue, in a way\u2014the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Right. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. There are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then Government's position. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law\u2014so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK\u2014that case law could come from other countries within the European Union."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "[Inaudible.]\u2014like common law jurisdictions would be."}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "Yes. At this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes. Okay. Thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about\u2014. There are over\u2014. From memory\u2014please never hold me to this\u2014but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. There are some offences on the statute\u2014. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. So, we have various defences to do with Acts. I remember seeing some about Antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant\u2014what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything\u2014that would be a nonsense\u2014or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. So, awareness is important and it comes back to that point."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?"}, {"speaker": "Barry Hughes", "content": "No. It's a potential barrier, but I don't think it is a barrier. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier. I think, particularly given the very low numbers we're talking about, we would be able to manage it.

In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means .

So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ?

Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "How do I um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "S That's on view ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh that's gonna {disfmarker} Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like {disfmarker} it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "okay . I've never used one . No ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's like l this {disfmarker} like that , and then you do that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah and then ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And then you can have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing {vocalsound} like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that {disfmarker} Or it {disfmarker} oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , you can {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well i"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "zap ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , click o actually click on to have {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah .

Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Like you could just have {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I don't know ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh , like {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "you could click and then have it up and down ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh you could actually {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Like {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah yeah yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be {disfmarker} is that part of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} I don't think so ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "yeah , I dunno , I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "they have so much memory though , that's {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You don't think so ?

And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something .

And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there .

So I guess the next thing is this uh {disfmarker} bleep editing ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right . So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker} We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want . So I 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece {disfmarker} pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . And so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "a single password .

I mean if people have {disfmarker} Uh , I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it . And then {pause} um {pause} if I thought it was OK , I 'd say \" it 's OK \" ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "And , I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} I mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Right , I mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I had already done for {pause} other reasons ."}, {"speaker": "Professor E", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "And so that {disfmarker} that 's a minor part of it , I just wanted some web interface so that people {disfmarker} you didn't actually have to send everyone the text .

Yeah , and Um I {disfmarker} that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but um we have to know what we want first .

I guess that 's"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "You can technically wear that as you 're talking ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , it 's right , I guess I can do that ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Darn ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Put it in your , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "I guess this board works fine . So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of {disfmarker} we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm . ROVER , the ROVER decision ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "The what decision ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "ROVER . All of their outputs combined to make a decision ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So we would like to do this kind of combination ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Alright , so um Is that uh I {disfmarker} yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "I think so , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "It 's {disfmarker} it 's cl e is {disfmarker} is it clear what he wants to compute ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . So , right . So Basically um {vocalsound} what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "because that 's obviously not desirable . What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So those are the two things that we uh need . So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step {disfmarker} that 's the uh yeah that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the basic uh thing . Now"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Um Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Is that all OK ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And that one outcome , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "What ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "it 's X {disfmarker} X - one voted for A X - two voted for V"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "and so forth ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Y right . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's the outcome ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "so that"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So step two is um right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "X - one matters more i than X - two or"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you {disfmarker} you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's one ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "And that 'd be one . So that um also seems to work fine . And uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK , so {disfmarker} so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh {comment} W one times {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Point three ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "or A or {disfmarker} let 's see , one full quarter times point one"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Not one quarter ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So you can view these as gone ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Probability of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So {disfmarker} so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So H passes a vector on to the next node ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "It could ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "It could ? A vector of the weights as the se"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , it could"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "oh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Sorry ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right , so I mean the way you desc"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the {disfmarker} that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It {disfmarker} it just seems that like without that {disfmarker} that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if {disfmarker} if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they {disfmarker} they could either be hand coded or learned or OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Based on training data , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well I mean we need data with people intentions , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Which is slightly tricky . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm . But what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? Mm - hmm . Oh right . Oh good . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we {disfmarker} I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub uh {pause} you know s S ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Well , basically you would say , based on {disfmarker} in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm . Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So this is what we wanna learn . Yep . Right . Hmm . Yeah . I don't think , well you have a {disfmarker} can you bring up the function thing ? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "That 's on the added variable , isn't it ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Oh function properties , is that it ? Hmm , I guess not . Yeah , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . OK . And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Ah . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So Yeah . Yeah . By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given {disfmarker} being asked ? Cuz {disfmarker} OK . Yeah yeah . OK . OK . Fey , you mean . OK . OK . O OK . OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean uh w the figure {disfmarker} I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was {disfmarker} uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me .

So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You mean the loo the look , the outside ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The look , how it look like ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , the the look is is bad for them"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so uh it's your job , David , maybe .

And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So this is from the experiments we've done ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .

Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think possible .

The second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll now go to Mr. Genuis."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC)", "content": "Mr. Chair, for over 10 years, members of Parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking.

It's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to Vancouver and has one of the nation's busiest general aviation airports. Last weekend the community came together to celebrate Pitt Meadows Day a little differently because of COVID. In a great show of community spirit, from their front yards and balconies, thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city.

The Bloc is open to the idea, but we shouldn't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action. There are already potential solutions for taking action. Commissions have been issuing reports for decades, and Ottawa has been tabling them. Last year alone, the Viens report and the report stemming from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls contained dozens of recommendations. The federal government must work with indigenous peoples, Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces. Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP. Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures. Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation.

For many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely. The sad reality is that even before the crisis hit, most rural Canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable Internet connection, even though Internet is an essential service. Those in underserved areas, including many parts of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon, cannot work from home and their children cannot keep up with their classmates. For many of my indigenous constituents, Internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies don't want to serve them. I, along with my colleagues, launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions.

They deserve to know that this government spending was scrutinized and passed through the rigours of Parliament. It is Canadian taxpayers of today and tomorrow who will have the responsibility to pay for this government's spending. It is Canadian workers and businesses who will have to do the hard work of rebuilding our economy. It is real Canadians who fall through the cracks when this Liberal government's programs fail to meet their intended goals. A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety is not democracy. Canadians are owed better.

Our graduating class, especially, saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish. The future belongs to them. They must follow their dreams. I want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things. We have all taken on our important responsibility, that of following the guidelines. The results have been most compelling in my riding. I want to say how proud I am to represent you here, in the Canadian Parliament. I thank each and everyone of you.

First, he locked down Parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition, while the economic recovery must be prepared. He is refusing to provide an economic update, even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer is calling for it. We need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic. He is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers. The increase Quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave, and not after it. Finally, today, he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed. He is behaving as if he had a majority government. This is not a time for recklessness.

Only the government's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the Auditor General's ability to give Canadians the answers they deserve, and we wonder why.

With our current resources, we expect to be able to deliver 14 performance audits each year. That's half the number of audits, despite a massive explosion in government spending.

That deserves some thought. That is what we are elected to do. We do not need to spend eight months on this, we can fix it in a few hours.

Just to put it on the record, because we may or may not be debating it, the draft embargoed bill that we've seen is unacceptable to members of the Green Party caucus. My questions will relate largely to those sections that are troublesome. I'll start with a question to the honourable minister for disabilities. I certainly appreciate her work and I know her intentions are the best, but part 3 of this bill allows for the information to be shared so people can get a one-time payment of $600, which is not enough to really deal with the COVID crisis for people with disabilities. It's clearand I thank the honourable leader of the New Democratic Party for making this point clearly in question periodit will reach approximately 40% of people with disabilities because of the structure of going through the disability tax credit. To the honourable minister, are other measures under consideration to reach the rest of the people in Canada with disabilities who need help?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Carla Qualtrough", "content": "Madam Chair, the disability support payment we are proposing and that we hope to get through the House today complements a whole suite of measures our government has put in place that people with disabilities have access to. We know that people with disabilities who were precariously employed are now taking advantage of the CERB. Students with disabilities get the student benefit, including a $750-per-month top-up for four months. Families with children with disabilities are getting the CCB payment. Disproportionately, people with disabilities are benefiting from the GST payment. I should talk about the provincial letters that are being delivered to recipients of provincial disability supports. All around, Madam Chair, we're trying to get to every citizen with a disability, and this measure fills an important gap."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May", "content": "Much worse than part 3, from our point of view, is the treatment of people who are at this point potentially to be jailed for refusing to return to work when it's considered reasonable and they are recipients of CERB. I wonder about the reasonableness here. It's a subjective test. This is a wrong-headed approach to go after people and threaten them. The retroactive section has already made the Canadian Civil Liberties Association question its constitutionality. To the minister, what's reasonable, and in whose eyes is it reasonable? In today's news, Hamilton's chief medical officer says there is a spike in cases among young people, who likely were exposed while taking public transit to get to work. Their commute wasn't safe. Who determines reasonableness in deciding it's not safe to go back to work?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Carla Qualtrough", "content": "Madam Chair, as with the current CERB, moving forward it tries to encompass the situations of people who are unemployed, people who can't work because of child care responsibilities, people who are ill or sick. Moving to a broad term of reasonableness allows us to look at the individual circumstances of the person. If we stuck to language like suitable or appropriate, that would qualify the job. We're trying to look at the person and their particular circumstances as we work to ensure that if someone is immunocompromised and can't take transit to their job, then it's reasonable for them not to take that job. That's the exact example we're trying to encompass with broad reasonableness criteria."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May", "content": "The approach is so very flawed, Madam Chair, in that it attempts to punish people as opposed to encouraging them. I think the Liberals have been overly influenced by the Conservative Party's cries that there's vast fraud, that Canadians are cheating. The reality is that if you want to create an incentive to go back to work, you don't threaten people. What you do is create a sliding scale. You let people continue to receive CERB, but maybe less as they begin to earn more, so that you have a transition on a sliding scale to go into the wage subsidy or into CERB. I ask the honourable minister this: How can it be considered fair to say that someone isn't eligible, even though they believed they were? The language in this bill, particularly at proposed paragraph 12.1 in the penalties section, is an unreasonable determination that someone has violated the act and is subject to jail time and heavy fines."}, {"speaker": "Hon.

We're absolutely confident that those people will find a path forward. We want to deal with intentional fraudsters, people who are criminally taking advantage of seniors.

We want to make sure that as we ask people to go back to work, we don't disincentivize work, but the reality is that there won't be jobs there for everyone, and we need to continue to support everyone."}, {"speaker": "The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends)", "content": "Mr.Trudel, you have the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Denis Trudel (LongueuilSaint-Hubert, BQ)", "content": "MadamChair, I join my colleague in extending my good wishes to you on Portugal's national day. Apart from the fact that it is probably the most beautiful riding in Quebec, the riding of LongueuilSaint-Hubert has surely been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, both in terms of health and the economy. There are industries here, but also many service businesses, including bars, restaurants and theatres. But we aren't close to being able to go back and see a show by WajdiMouawad or FredPellerin, and that's a shame. We must work to calm the anxiety of these people. The arts sector was the first to stop its activities and will be the last to resume them. There is a lot of anxiety. The CERB ends on July4. Will the government extend the CERB, with an employment incentive?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Steven Guilbeault", "content": "MadamChair, I thank my colleague for his question and all the work he's doing in arts and culture. From the outset, we've been there to support our artists and arts organizations. We introduced the Canada emergency response benefit, for example, but also the emergency wage subsidy, which we made available to non-governmental organizations. To ensure that people who receive royalties aren't penalized under the Canada emergency response benefit, we have adapted it. We announced a $500million fund to specifically help the arts and culture sector. In fact, we understand very well that this sector has been severely affected by the current crisis. We've been there for our artists and artisans, and we will continue to be."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Denis Trudel", "content": "Perfect.

It's final; it won't reopen. Another restaurant owner told me that he was going to reopen his restaurant, but he didn't know at what capacity. Would it be at 15%, 30%, 40%? No one knows. The speed at which the economy will recover is the big unknown. How many hours a week will it be able to offer its employees? Will it be 12hours, 15hours, 22hours? Will employees even want to return to work to put in 12hours a week? If the CERB isn't adjusted, nothing will happen.

The New Brunswick potato industry is sitting on a massive amount of last year's crop that, because of the pandemic, has no buyers. When will the Prime Minister and the government step up and deliver the support our farmers so desperately need?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

It has been over a month since that announcement, and our farmers are still waiting for help. It is worth noting, Madam Chair, that vegetables like the potatoes in New Brunswick that I previously mentioned are perishable products. Our farmers do not have the luxury of time.

Mlanie Joly", "content": "Madam Chair, obviously we believe in the importance of our regions and our rural communities, and that's why we've always made sure that agriculture was at the core of many of the decisions throughout this pandemic. That's why our colleague Minister Bibeau, who is the Minister of Agriculture, has been there providing the right liquidity and the right support through this pandemic.

Marco Mendicino", "content": "Madam Chair, of course we look forward to saying more about that, but of course we remain committed to taking those guns that have only one objective, and that is to kill people.

So then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? So the thinking behind that was {vocalsound} we have the features that we 've drawn {pause} from the communication of some {disfmarker} Like , the someone s The person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like \" I 'm {disfmarker} \" the {disfmarker} the abstract idea being \" I am a tourist I want to go {pause} to this place . \" Right ?

Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist {pause} or {pause} whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . Or {disfmarker} Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the {disfmarker} from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good . So then the hidden variables {disfmarker} hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to {disfmarker} like {disfmarker} or th"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Want to do Vista ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad B", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "right ?

So I think they 're {disfmarker} they 're doing something like that . I think that they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} I think what I mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard .

Yeah . I 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wasn't this ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Um .

They {disfmarker} they clearly did actually remove {pause} silent sections in order {disfmarker} because they {pause} got these {pause} word error rate {pause} results . So um I think that it 's {disfmarker} it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gonna give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know . Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the {pause} word models are pretty bad and nobody wants {disfmarker} {pause} has {disfmarker} has approached improving them . So {pause} it 's possible that a lot of the problems {pause} with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models {pause} to begin with . So {pause} this might just be a temporary thing . But {disfmarker} But , on the other hand , and maybe {disfmarker} maybe it 's a decent idea . So um The question we 're gonna wanna go {pause} through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been {disfmarker} if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at {pause} uh , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band Uh , and we 've been looking at {pause} cross - language , cross {pause} task {pause} issues . And they 've been not so much looking at {pause} the cross task uh multiple language issues . But they 've been looking at uh {disfmarker} {pause} at these issues . At the on - line normalization and the uh {pause} voice activity detection . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about {pause} um what do we choose {pause} from what we 've looked at {pause} to um blend with {pause} some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that , {pause} how do we split up the {pause} effort ? Uh , because we still have {disfmarker} even once we choose , {pause} we 've still got {pause} uh another {pause} month or so , I mean there 's holidays in the way , but {disfmarker} but uh {pause} I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time {pause} to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites {pause} in that {disfmarker} that amount of time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's {disfmarker} {pause} knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , see they , I {disfmarker} I think they 're Um . I don't know the {disfmarker} {pause} the specifics of how they 're doing it .

Maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "So . Uh . Uh , you know that 's what I had thought .

It hopefully brings other {pause} people up to date a bit . And um Um {pause} I think {disfmarker} Uh , I wanna look at these numbers off - line a little bit and think about it and {disfmarker} {pause} and talk with everybody uh , {pause} outside of this meeting . Um , but uh No I mean it sounds like {disfmarker} I mean {pause} there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there are the usual number of {disfmarker} of {pause} little {disfmarker} little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out . And now we 're {pause} seem to be kind of in a position to actually {pause} uh , {pause} look at stuff and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and compare things . So I think that 's {disfmarker} that 's pretty good . Um {pause} I don't know what the {disfmarker} One of the things I wonder about , {pause} coming back to the first results you talked about , is {disfmarker} is {pause} how much , {pause} uh {pause} things could be helped {pause} by more parameters . And uh {disfmarker} {pause} And uh how many more parameters we can afford to have , {vocalsound} {pause} in terms of the uh computational limits .

Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form .

Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source {disfmarker} source .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what {disfmarker} which he believes it is ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you say mute , he repeats mute and you {disfmarker} makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Uh well {disfmarker} uh"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "d did we already decide on the display ? To {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Well , I don't have um {disfmarker} I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information {disfmarker} uh y I don't think you need it on a display ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I I don't think either ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'cause uh {gap} uh all {disfmarker} any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . Okay , well"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "th"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the {disfmarker} a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Kineti okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The kinetic thing it {gap} it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm {disfmarker} I think you should combine it with batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Otherwise it will not {disfmarker} too advanced ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "too {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "uh well ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It's {disfmarker} in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but that {disfmarker} that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But {disfmarker} Yes . And I think it's more robust ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It's more uh Uh it's more functional ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But what about um the markets {vocalsound} uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No no , but the uh um {disfmarker} that's what Sebastian said ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference .

Oh ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "sorry . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and we should uh use wood or something like that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And I would think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "r"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "rubber with colours ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "the {disfmarker} yeah , the older people liked wood ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Oh okay , sorry .

Maybe that's an uh {disfmarker} a different {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "oh ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But but do we want the curved uh uh design ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "evalu"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap} I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I it's too dull .

This was particularly true for his own sector, the civil engineering sector, and particularly contracting sector. Because pupils usually did not have a very strong academic background in this sector, and Welsh bac gave them the opportunity to not pursue that much of academic, but tested them in terms of the challenges. Therefore, the growth of the Welsh bac would be valued at least for this sector.", "relevant_text_span": [["9", "12"]]}, {"query": "What did they decide on how to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac?", "answer": "They proposed that the voice of employers should be a key part of reviewing the qualification.

To develop the employability skills was obviously a key part of it, but not all of it. It obviously worked well to help prepare for employment, but was not for everyone, because some people had to do the other things.

For example, there were a number of students who needed to resit their GCSE. It was important for everybody to get a C grade in those core subjects, but that would take some time from them teaching young people. Therefore, there were fewer and fewer doing level 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs.

I'll be asking my questions in Welsh."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru\u00a0would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac\u00a0there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac\u00a0means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac\u00a0is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac\u00a0at present."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Which is a big problem."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues\u00a0within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly\u00a0meet with\u2014employers\u2014and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require\u2014the Welsh bac\u2014to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within\u00a0those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac\u00a0initially, but the Welsh bac\u00a0has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the\u00a0year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand\u00a0the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications\u00a0that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Kay, is that your experience?"}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications.\u00a0But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they\u00a0want them to be literate, numerate, and they want them to have digital skills. And that isn't captured necessarily in the Welsh baccalaureate. And, so, the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And, finally, I know you've got strong views as an organisation."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "Do you mind if I carry on in English\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Fine."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "\u2014just so that a lot of our members will understand when I'm speaking. I think it's fair to say employers don't understand it, that's for sure, but I think if they did, they would really appreciate this. For my sector in particular\u2014the civil engineering sector\u2014and particularly the\u00a0contracting sector, which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to\u2014. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and\u00a0supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And some children, some pupils, some young people, they respond far, far better to that. And I think that's the issue for me\u2014that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would\u00a0be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?"}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within\u00a0that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications\u00a0board, I think\u00a0the employers\u2014. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the\u00a0vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate\u2014that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "I will carry on in English, if that's okay."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes, it's no problem."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "I would agree. I think we do need more employers involved in this. I think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment. I suppose that the bee in\u00a0my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector, and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way. It happens at the moment. It's the community benefits clauses that are in construction contracts. They're there to serve a really good purpose, but it's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic, whereas the Welsh bac offers an opportunity\u2014. It's something that's part of the curriculum. It's clearly not functioning well at the moment. It would benefit from that business input. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more\u00a0structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit\u2014we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we\u00a0join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days\u2014they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We've got BTEC learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with Freshfields law in London, which is one of the top law firms in the world. So, there are lots of other programmes as well, and perhaps there's a way of joining it all up together. But, in the college, we've got several different programmes going on with employers and the Welsh bac is one of them, but it's not the one that engages employers the best, certainly in our college."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, do we get rid of it?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You don't need to answer that. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I mean, if there are so many other programmes helping anyway, why do we need it?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "I think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac\u2014I think when we go back a number of years\u2014was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers\u2014. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is: have we got programmes already in place, and do we need another one on top? But the vision initially for the Welsh bac, as I said, I will always be positive about. The vision was a good one."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I'd like to expand on what Nick said. It's important for you to understand that although we always try and put the learner first, funding does drive behaviours, and the Welsh bac is fundable; Career Ready isn't. So, yes, there are options out there, but because we're so focused on qualifications and we will only fund qualifications, that drives certain behaviours, and\u00a0I think you need as a committee to be very much aware of that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you've got a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, but that was very useful information for us, because bearing in mind what Nick Brazil said\u2014that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a Duke of Edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification; what was important was that the learners got the skills.\u00a0However, if getting the qualification is how you get the money, then you can see why schools\u2014well, and indeed colleges\u2014might be tempted to go for it. So, thank you for that. Diolch."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Have you finished? Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Good morning. What are your views on how well the Welsh bac, at all levels, helps to prepare learners for employment? We've spoken to quite a few learners, and again we've had variable opinions coming back, so it's quite how they, from their perspective\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities. And one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs\u2014in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a\u00a0C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow\u2014no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector\u2014. We've given priority to GCSE\u00a0resits\u00a0rather than doing the Welsh bac\u00a0at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification\u2014it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac\u2014for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well\u2014that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes\u2014and we all get funded on the outcomes\u2014that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh\u2014I thought that's something that we need to think about."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "If I could just say as well, our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people, and we use every tool in our box to do that. And, as I said earlier, there are lots of things that we do. The Welsh bac, where it works really well, does help prepare them, I think, for employment, but it's not for everyone, because some people have to do the other things. Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels, even in a vocational programme, it's too big for them. As you say, they're coming from schools, some of them with very few GCSEs, or they haven't got literacy and numeracy skills, they're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy. So, I think it needs to be reviewed, to look at how we could make skilled and employable people. It helps prepare some people\u2014the A-level students for university\u2014but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Great advocates."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "\u2014and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then\u2014'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges,\u00a0but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented\u2014we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that\u00a0have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac\u2014normally."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us\u2014certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners\u2014that a number of them have come from school and\u00a0probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do\u2014think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a\u00a0low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay.\u00a0A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac?"}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities. They do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade. I talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a Russell Group university because she had the Welsh bac as well, but it was a very paper-based exercise. But I think it is mixed, and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they're going into in universities. In some areas, and certainly the local universities around here\u2014University of South Wales, Cardiff Metropolitan University\u2014value it in a great number of subjects, particularly in sport, when our students go to Cardiff Met, and business studies, when our learners go to USW. It is valued by them and they accept it, but when people go further afield\u2014and we're always trying to push our learners beyond. Where they can afford to go away to university, we encourage that. But some of the universities are not valuing the Welsh baccalaureate."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Did you have a supplementary, Si\u00e2n?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. You didn't mention Cardiff University there."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Cardiff University\u2014yes. My daughter's example\u2014that was Cardiff University. So, they do, especially now it's graded at level 3. Then they do accept it. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt\u2014in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities,\u00a0the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about facilitating subjects, and Welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Maybe Dafydd can give us the picture from north Wales."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I mentioned before coming in, in terms of the context\u2014. Because of the nature of our catchment area, there is a greater percentage of our students staying in Welsh universities, and, as Kay said, Welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac. So, to a certain extent, it is less of a problem. But, naturally, we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group, and we're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But in terms of Bangor and Glynd\u0175r University, there's no problem there, though."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "No, there is no problem there."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up to a Russell university's expectations, and on the other hand, it's trying to develop softer skills and employment skills for people going into work from a vocational area. Can the same product deliver those two outcomes? I'm certainly not sure, and perhaps we need to think: what are we trying to achieve with this qualification?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Yes, and earlier, we talked as well about that difference for the A-level students. They know what it is. It's worth UCAS points. For the vocational students, some things like the Career Ready programme, which is used in other colleges, and WorldSkills, you know, where all colleges have really been pushing to get more learners into WorldSkills at national and international level. And for some of our learners, particularly if we take our engineering learners, then having somebody who has competed in Europe as a tiler or an electrician would, I think, make an employer think, 'I'd better look at this person', whereas the other one\u00a0has done the Welsh bac\u2014.\u00a0I think they would look at the WorldSkills person first. And the investment we have to put into WorldSkills is huge. So, for some of our learners, we choose that you do WorldSkills, because that is going to be more valuable for you as a skill, and to show to an employer how much extra time you've put in. So, they put a lot of time\u2014you know, to get somebody into a WorldSkills competition is not just a couple of hours a week, it isn't just the normal curriculum\u2014they have extra time. They are more able and talented vocational learners, and that is more valuable to those learners and I think it's more valid for employers than the Welsh baccalaureate."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "I think it's got to, extending on what Kay says\u2014. It's got to be\u2014. You know, it is comparable, as long as it's right for that learner's future. If it's right for the learner's future, absolutely it's comparable. But if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the Welsh bac is not accepted, it's not comparable. But, then, if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector, absolutely. But it's got to be right for the learner."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "What are the reasons why some colleges do see it as being rigorous and others don't? Why does the view vary?"}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "Can I give perhaps an employer's perspective on that, which might be completely wrong, but it's been interesting listening to what's been said here? About a year ago, we bought the\u00a0WJEC in to speak to our employers, or a number of them, just to explain to them what the Welsh bac was about\u2014back to listening and about understanding, really, and it just was not there at all. I could see that most of the employers\u00a0there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels. We've kind of gone into an university discussion here, but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. The skills that they bring having gone through this process I think most of the employers could get, at least in my sector, they could understand\u2014'I can see what that person can do.' But we've also seen it from university-educated people as well. They are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things. Those that bring a little bit of world experience, a little bit of the Welsh bac-type of things, just become far more rounded and useful people. I can understand why there's a certain obsession, almost, with the academic side of it, but I think we lose that vocational bit at our peril, and to a certain extent we probably haven't got it in many quarters anyway. So, for me, the Welsh bac helps to build that. Call it something else maybe, but that's what it should do."}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "It probably depends on the subjects that\u00a0people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac\u2014even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac\u00a0in terms of\u2014I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac\u00a0within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. So, there are some very positive things coming out there. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac\u00a0are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "I think the baccalaureate\u00a0approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac\u00a0is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac\u00a0anyway. It's just not fair on the learners or the people teaching the bac. Is that a fair observation?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac\u00a0under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. It might be different post 16\u2014I accept that. Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "And obviously practice will differ across schools."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Julie, did you have any more questions?"}, {"speaker": "Julie Morgan AM", "content": "No, I've finished, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners,\u00a0i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac\u00a0is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "That is not the case, I would say. When a learner comes to us, we\u2014. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have\u00a0a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their Welsh language skills. We don't say, 'Come to us and you don't have to do the Welsh bac,' because if they do A-levels, we say it's compulsory, unless you're in the Seren group."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. Well, that's the point; it's about English-speaking students, not just Welsh\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "No, it isn't used. In the majority of colleges across Wales, it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool, because most of us, as you see, we value the Welsh bac. We'd like some changes to the Welsh bac, but we value the Welsh bac\u00a0in many cases. So, we wouldn't deliberately\u2014. I mean, if a course in my college doesn't want to do the Welsh bac, they have to come and give me evidence about why they don't think it's fit and what they're going to do in place of it. So, we don't deliberately tell people, 'Come\u00a0on in and you won't have to do it.'"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, can I run that across you all, in an outburst of honesty?"}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Yes, absolutely. We universally adopt at level 3, but we don't at levels 1 and 2."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Oh, yes, for the reasons you've given in the evidence, actually."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Yes, but across the whole of level 3, A-level and vocational, the Welsh bac\u00a0is an integral part of the curriculum, and it isn't an option for the student to opt out."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Do you let your Seren\u00a0students opt out like they do in Cardiff and the Vale, or do they have to do it as well?"}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "We've forced\u2014. No, sorry, 'forced' is not the word. [Laughter.] We have encouraged and persuaded everybody to do it."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, that will be four A-levels plus bac."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "I've got to be honest, at present, with our college, we do not ask. It's compulsory for A-level students to do the Welsh bac. It's an option of one of our choices\u2014we have a large choice\u2014and I think it comes back to that fact that we're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions. I think it's something we all need to consider across the nation, that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future. I will go back to the point I made earlier\u2014everything's comparable as long as it's the right thing for the learner's future, and I genuinely believe, and I'm sure a lot of colleagues believe, that that choice element is important to a learner, okay. If it is the right choice and if the Welsh bac\u00a0is the right choice, that is correct, and we move that along. Obviously, we debated about where there are elements that need to change. But you've got to be doing the right things for the learner, and we are certainly not selling it, 'Come\u00a0to us; you don't do the Welsh bac.' It is part of what we offer. It is part of what the college's curriculum offers\u2014there is no doubt about that\u2014and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. I've just got one question for Mr Ed Evans, if that's okay. You explained earlier that if people knew what the bac was about in your sector, they'd value it more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular\u2014who are needed in your sector, after all\u2014might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners\u2014presumably you need them all."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "We do. There's a big range, and some really high achievers coming into the sector as well. So, it is about that mix. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. The qualifications are well catered for. So, it's almost a given somebody's been through that route. What isn't there is some of those softer skills, but also some\u2014. I was almost going to call commercial skills 'soft' there\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Call them 'commercial'."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "Commercial skills are hard skills, which are very, very difficult to come by. So, the Welsh bac starts to do some of those things at different levels. Again, I'll come back to the input of businesses to support that delivery of commercial skills and so on, but I think I probably made that point earlier. So, I don't think it is a case of squeezing things out. There's clearly going to be different individuals who will cope better, and they will be, I guess, maybe guided as well by parents to a certain degree in terms of, 'You do those four and forget about that nonsense there', which is not helpful, but I can understand why that happens. So, for me, now, it's not a case of squeezing\u2014. This should be seen as an important part of creating a rounded individual ready for employment. I guess that's what a lot of our employers saw the Welsh bac\u00a0as being able to do. Whether that's a shared view is another matter."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "That's great. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come\u00a0to us for this particular reason.'"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask,\u00a0'Do\u00a0I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. It is always a question that people ask me. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually\u2014as I said\u2014have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come\u00a0to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "No. Education is about offering the range and offering it correctly."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I'm being devil's advocate."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes\u2014if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. So, I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra\u2014Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac\u00a0to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.'"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time\u2014and parents\u2014they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we\u00a0did\u2014. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Well, we'll move on now then to\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "That's a question."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You do want an answer. Anybody want to pick that up?"}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "We certainly have experience of that, of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude, originally, to the Welsh bac and taking it on board. But where we are delivering it well, well contextualised, they've really enjoyed the experience, and very much valued the experience. So, yes, there are certainly instances of that happening, there's no doubt."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "We certainly see it, as employers. The penny drops after a few weeks or\u00a0months."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "But don't underestimate the fact that\u00a0if you had a poor experience of the Welsh bac\u00a0at school, that perception is very difficult for us, as institutions, then, to change. Very difficult."}, {"speaker": "Dr Rachel Bowen", "content": "It does make it into quite an intensive selling process for colleges when they've got to overcome that negative perception. As people have said already, it is possible to talk parents and learners round, but then that's time spent having to do that selling job when we should be talking about other things."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "Can I just mention as well that there's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not A-levels? Perhaps you might want to do an engineering BTEC programme, or you might want to do a health and social care, or you might want to do hospitality. You might want to do BTEC\u00a0programmes, you can still go to university if that's what you want to do, or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards, and selling that whole range to parents, because there is an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?"}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I'm not assured in terms of\u2014yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside\u2014'Welsh bac\u00a0specialists' in inverted commas\u2014it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac\u00a0and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac\u2014. It's been an intensive staff development process."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac\u00a0are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. So, a number of those staff have already got those skills and they're undertaking that. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And have you got dedicated time? Because one of the things we picked up from schools was that teachers in particular were kind of fitting it in with other lessons, and therefore, it wasn't being, again, given the same perceived level of importance as doing A-levels were. But your lecturers would all have dedicated time to deliver\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "On their timetables, yes. And as you say, industry specialists delivering some of those things put them more into context."}, {"speaker": "Ed Evans", "content": "I was just going to add there, really, if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular, if you've got that\u00a0far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this\u2014. Apologies, I'd almost forgotten that we were in the Colegau thing, I was thinking 'schools' actually [Laughter.] But in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way\u2014. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board\u2014I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in\u00a0some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.'"}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. I think all my other points have been answered, Chair. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Can I just ask\u2014? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground."}, {"speaker": "Kay Martin", "content": "And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac\u00a0has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at\u2014. We've got industry experts in colleges. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning."}, {"speaker": "Nick Brazil", "content": "I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. I think we all support that. But is it quite right? I'm not sure at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Dafydd Evans", "content": "I'll agree. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac\u00a0is currently. Therefore, I think what we're saying is, if we're going universal adoption, it can't be with this product. This product isn't the product to universally adopt."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, that's interesting. Okay. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay. Well, can I thank you all for attending and for answering our questions? It's been a very informative and interesting discussion. We will, as usual, send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for your time this morning. Okay, item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill, paper to note 2 is the letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education to the Children's Commissioner for Wales on home education, and paper to note 3 is the letter that the Cabinet Secretary for Education has sent to us in reply to our letter about free school meals. Are Members happy to note those? Thank you. Item 4, then: can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content? Yes."}]}

More research into Welsh education would always be needed. As a Government, all aspects of concerns of Welsh education should be taken into consideration as the government was planning the new curriculum. For instance,  empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teached their children actually gave the government an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of the school children than what they had at the moment.", "relevant_text_span": [["46", "49"]]}, {"query": "What did the WISERD research suggest about the distinction in schools?", "answer": "Hefin David AM introduced that the WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams and classroom teachers would share different views towards the change since classroom teachers would be more sceptical.

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Suzy Davies is going to be arriving a little bit late. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No? Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement, knowledge and opportunity as possible. So, working through the regional consortia, approximately 120 separate events were organised, and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers, teachers, governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events. We also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves, so that they could give us their feedback. There were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people. We also held some specific events to engage with the business community. We'll all be familiar, won't we, with the narrative of, 'Oh, we're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for'. So we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process. And obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say. So, Members, I'm sure, will have been aware of the specific pages on Hwb that outlined the draft curriculum, and we had 275,000 unique visits to the Hwb curriculum pages. It's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience\u2014which particular AoLEs were the most popular and were being looked at the most\u2014with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular. So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change? So, support for the need for change, and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum. So, good levels of support for the four purposes, and that driving the content below it. Strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession\u2014so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. Also, a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas\u2014. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. So we'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we've had. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you, Minister. You said that you're reflecting on the messages that you've received. Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present.\u00a0So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. We had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools. But above and beyond the innovative schools, we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas, and they're the first part of that process. So, they met last week to begin looking at the feedback, and we'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine. Are there big changes to the concept? No. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen\u2014absolutely. We're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those, but in terms of the overall concept, then no, no significant changes."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. And what are the steps now before the final curriculum is published in January 2020?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, the quality\u2014. We call them\u2014it's not a very nice name\u2014quality improvement practitioners, the QI practitioners. So, these are the subject specialists. They met last week to begin this process. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. So, the editorial process will then be engaged to draw up the final example. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January\u2014am I right, Claire?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Bennett", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, January."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. We've got some specific questions now on the legislation from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "You've touched on the point that there's going to be some sort of change, and you've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation. We want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The original proposal that we began working on was, in the legislation, to provide for the four purposes\u2014so, the four purposes would be set out in the legislation\u2014as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you'll all be familiar with. Then, below that, we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects\u2014so, the literacy, the numeracy and the digital competency\u2014as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory, so, for instance, above and beyond what Graham Donaldson would have put in his original reports. A good example of that is relationships and sexuality education. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody\u2014. So, we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements. So, we're bringing it a step lower again. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber\u2014I can see Suzy is writing this down\u2014Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. As I said, we are proposing those changes because of responses that we've had. One of the consistent worries that some people have had, whilst being very supportive of the overall aims, is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school, but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern. So, we've reflected on that. I set up a process\u2014this was an open process, and we were open to listening to people. So, I think those will be the two main areas where we hadn't originally thought that we would legislate for, but that we will now legislate for."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Great. That's very helpful. I haven't got the 'what matters'\u00a0statements in front of me\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, if you remember, we have the four purposes, and then we have the areas of learning and experience, and then, below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience. So, we're going to be refining some of those. Some of the feedback that we've had is that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, will you be adding to those?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Adding is not necessarily\u2014no, not adding. But, for instance, the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience. So, they'll be refined, but not added to, and then we will legislate for them, and that hadn't been the original intention."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. Will they include mental health and well-being?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, the area of learning and experience for well-being is already there, and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "They are in the annex to the paper, Si\u00e2n, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Claire, am I explaining it okay?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Bennett", "content": "Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So, the idea is to make sure that those are consistent, and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those, which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them. But the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'\u2014it was never what was intended. They were always intended to represent, as a whole, the learning that every learner should get. They won't be literally in the Bill, because, obviously, you might want to change the emphasis, so that'll be provided for in subordinate legislation, but the provision will be there, and they will have the status of something that's not optional, basically, for a school."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Therefore, it's not going to be on the face of the Bill\u2014the mental health aspect, for example. And there are other matters that we've raised here. This is what I'm not clear about. You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. Over time, the 'what matters' statements might change. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. So, for instance, education is changing all the time. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that\u2014. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process\u2014. So, the wording of the 'what matters' statement will be in secondary legislation. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Suzy, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years\u2014I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again\u2014you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. So, I'm just asking you to consider that."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We're assuming so."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And we'll have an opportunity to influence it. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. I think amongst the things that people have objected to were\u2014. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning. Many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger\u2014and in some cases exclusive\u2014focus on Christianity, as opposed to including other world religions and, indeed, non-religious views. So, secular views or spiritual\u2014spirituality rather than organised religion. There were people who thought that RE shouldn't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that RE was compulsory, people objected to that, on the other\u2014. And there were many responses that were concerned about and emphasised the need to respect parents' views. So, if a child's parents have certain views, those are to be respected. Of those respondents that agreed that RE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, or were neutral\u2014didn't express an opinion either way, but were neutral on the question\u2014the issues that they were bringing forward were: a need for learners, as they saw it, to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society. So, they wanted RE to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions. They felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is, as you say, diverse with people of different views living in it. There is certainly a need to modernise RE; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned. And also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed, modernised RE curriculum. So, those are the issues around religious education\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Can I just\u2014? Before you go on to the next section\u2014is there evidence that this was a co-ordinated lobby to present a particular view and what is your response going to be to this? Obviously, there are always going to be lobbies presenting particular viewpoints. Our role, as politicians, is to lead, obviously, isn't it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. Claire, would you say that it was a co-ordinated response?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Bennett", "content": "It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue\u2014on this one and on relationships and sex education."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And your response?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And my response: well, clearly, Si\u00e2n, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum\u2014that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum. So, those were the main areas that people were concerned about. With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. So, I have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise. I think these are really important aspects of our curriculum. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system\u2014how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. So, that's January. We would expect to introduce the Bill following the Easter recess."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. That gives enough time, then, for it to be\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "\u2014actually implemented in September\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "In 2022."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "In 2022, yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I always\u2014and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And how do you respond, then\u2014? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to\u2014. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into\u2014that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful\u2014and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful\u2014it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself\u2014it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know\u2014who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school\u2014? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft\u2014typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the two. So, the curriculum on its own will not be enough. It is the four enabling objectives that sit around it, and we have to be cognisant of the WISERD's research, of course we do, to ensure that, as we're doing our professional learning, as we're planning well-being for our children, as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools\u2014and we have some, we have many, but we need to do more to support them\u2014it is that that will make the biggest difference, not just the content of the curriculum on its own. Although I do believe the flexibility that we're allowing people will, I think, lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they don't understand why they're being asked to learn what they're learning, they don't see the relevance of what they're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are, or they don't see themselves reflected. So, for some of our communities, they don't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we're teaching at the moment. And, again, international research would suggest that, if you want a child to thrive, they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they're learning in schools."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "What the WISERD research suggests is that the senior management teams\u2014the management teams\u2014would certainly buy into what you've just said, but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "As I said, classroom teachers are absolutely crucial to this, which is why, first of all, we've taken the difficult step to delay the implementation of the curriculum to give us the time that we need to make sure that it's not just school leaders but it is individual classroom practitioners who have the skills that they need to make the most of the opportunity that the curriculum allows them."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'\u2014this is from classroom teachers\u2014 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of\u2014. Read the first bit again. Was it\u2014[Interruption.] Accountability, yes."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Yes: 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.'"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, as always, in education, teachers\u2014understandably, because this is the regime that they have been a part of\u2014immediately don't think about their pedagogy, they think about, 'How are judgments going to be made upon me as an individual?' And what we're trying to do is ensure that we are developing another accountability regime that is indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and doesn't work against the purposes of the curriculum. So, I understand why teachers are concerned. They spend a lot of time thinking about accountability and how they're going to be held accountable for their practice, but, again, what we want to do is provide reassurance that we are devising an accountability regime for our system that is in line with the purposes of the curriculum and puts us in line with the mainstream thought and reform process across the world of progressive education systems."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "It was the segregation bit I was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't\u2014. I do not believe that any changes\u2014and I would not pursue any changes that\u2014would lead to a segregation."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Okay. And with regard to the connection between Welsh Government and local government and the concerns that the Welsh Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Education Wales raised, what progress\u00a0has been made on bridging the gap between\u2014? Whether it's a perception gap or a practice gap, what progress has been made on that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I think the last time we had this conversation in the committee I said that I think the comments that the WLGA and ADEW had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date, and I think progress had been made in that time, and I'm pleased to report the significant progress that's been made\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Bridges have been built."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Bridges have been\u2014. Well, from my perspective, the bridges were always there. But we've got renewed, energetic engagement from the WLGA and ADEW in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they're very supportive of what's going on."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "I'm sure they're watching and nodding vigorously now on Senedd.tv."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And I will be with them tomorrow night and Friday morning and I'm sure if they've got any other views they'll let me know."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "And the final question: there is a process, a model for this, which is Scotland. What kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say\u2014and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought\u2014. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment. Assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in. Professional learning, ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes, I think they would agree that that wasn't necessarily\u2014. The middle tier, which they don't have to the\u2014. Well, they've got local authorities and regions, but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing. So, I think we've learned\u2014. Although our curriculum isn't a copycat, as I said, we have been able to learn from, and we've had people who have been deeply involved in the Scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we've had in terms of developing coherence. But, Steve, I don't know if\u2014. You speak to your Scottish colleagues quite a lot."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "As I said, they're very forthright in sharing their learning and I think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. So, that was critical, but we've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group. So, they feed in throughout\u2014not 'don't do this because Scotland has done it', but they feed some of that learning into the system. As the Minister said, we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The particular focus of this year's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from Scotland, from Ireland, from Iceland, from Finland, from Saskatchewan, from Nova Scotia and from Uruguay."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "When did that take place?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Where?"}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "When."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The weekend just gone."}, {"speaker": "Hefin David AM", "content": "Right."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy. You've got a whole section on assessment, I don't know\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "This isn't about assessment."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Oh, okay. Go on, then."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, on the basis that this is not about assessment, you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from Scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods\u2014? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think\u2014again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually\u2014the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset\u2014with the exception of the extension of the one year\u2014was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think\u2014. Claire, do you want to add to that, or\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Claire Bennett", "content": "I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just going off in isolation. The other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network. So, there'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience, bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development, bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed. So, I think that a huge amount of thinking, particularly in the regions, has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools, not just in engaging with the curriculum now, but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools. It feels like\u2014I think Graham Donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process'. You don't start in 2022\u2014people are already doing it and there's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And I think that's another difference, you see\u2014that strong middle tier and the role that the middle tier is playing in Wales, which was absent in Scotland. So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes\u2014I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I just have a quick\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes, sorry, I completely understand. Was one of the things that Scotland did\u2014I don't want to use the word 'assess'\u2014to monitor the pupil response to the curriculum as one of the means of deciding whether curricula in particular schools were working well enough?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I don't know if they\u2014. I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime\u2014so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves. But that's the beauty of working with other countries. They found that particular useful and successful, and we're keen to see if we could do something similar."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Thank you. I'll keep my questions shorter."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "The next questions are from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. Yes, just around preparations for the implementation, really. You touched on this briefly in response to some questions from Hefin David earlier on, but I'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation, how that's actually been used. What specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation? I know you've set aside about \u00a324 million over two years. So, it's not an insignificant amount. I just wondered how that was being utilised."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "You're right, first of all, it's not an insignificant amount; it's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. So, investing in the profession is absolutely crucial. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, there hasn't been a national programme, as such."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they're going to need. There's no way I can know that. The people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools. But we have worked with the National Academy for Educational Leadership to put together a programme for headteachers, and that's national. The four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement. So, actually, the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum. The next stages will be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning. So, there is a national approach in terms of leadership. The regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants, and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics. Claire referred to the AoLE networks, and there's an opportunity then for people to engage in that. It's also important to say that that's not the end of the process. So, this September is the start of our new ITE courses, taught for the first time, and that's great. I'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ITE. So, we're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support, again on a national basis, for those who are newly qualified, beginning their teaching career, because I don't think we've done that on a consistently good level across the country. We're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system. We're also involved in\u2014and I'm sure the committee has heard about it, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground\u2014schools as learning organisations and the OECD work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation. We know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong, strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system, and we've not been very good at that in Wales, we've not been strong at that, that's not the culture that we have had. We've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you're good or bad, rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about, 'What are we doing well and what do we need to improve on?' So, the schools as learning organisations are an important part, again, so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the OECD."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. And the money that you announced for this\u00a0\u00a0professional development preparation, if you like, was for two years. So, there's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development, as well as anything else. But is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues? Or do you see what you've put in as being, 'This is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation. The rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that'?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and, clearly, I continue to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning, and I'm sure this committee and, indeed, members of this committee could help me in that task."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay, fine. Can you tell us a bit about the innovation schools\u2014the 16 innovation schools\u2014and how you've made your decisions about who they might be, across which sectors, in primary, secondary and so on? So, basically, how they were selected and what you're expecting of them."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase, which is innovation schools, and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within Welsh Government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us, going forward. I think one of the lessons learned, and this was said in the committee, was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools, but there was a downside to having pioneer schools, and I think, at this stage of the game, we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now\u2014everybody had to be a pioneer\u2014because this is coming down the track and we don't want anybody just sitting there waiting until September 2022 and saying, 'Oh, gosh. I've got to do something new today'. Not that they would have done that, but\u2014. So, the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we've all got to engage in this now. The innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement, and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues. Steve."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "Yes. There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools. We've had 16\u2014four per region. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Claire Bennett", "content": "Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole\u2014so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice\u2014'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector\u2014secondary, primary\u2014but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. Faith schools, as well, are involved. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly\u2014not exactly\u2014 but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?'"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Si\u00e2n has a supplementary. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, sure. No problem at all."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools\u2014? I understand that they are discussing in clusters, and so on, but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now?"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "I can't tell you that, absolutely, 100 per cent are definitely, totally, absolutely equally involved. The structure we've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually\u2014not readiness to engage\u2014start to deliver as we move through to the future. So, each region is a member of our operations board, which was in our governance structure. And we don't have a roll-call against all schools, but we require them, or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks. Every school is part of a network that links to it, and they gauge (1) the level of activity in it, (2) the outcomes of that work, because each of the networks, each of the clusters, produces work that the region brings together. But we've not got a monitoring system that says, 'Tick every box'. What I would say, and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to Scotland, I think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this, it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver. At a regional level, we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I just wanted to clarify, because in your paper you talk about giving \u00a330,000 to each, or to the innovation schools. Was that \u00a330,000 each, or \u00a330,000 for the project?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Each school that participates in the innovation schools programme gets \u00a330,000."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you for that clarification. My final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in Wales. So, teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. How are we actually going to deal with that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, you're right\u2014we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. I think that that will continue to happen. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. Clearly, already in some ways, programmes of study are already distinctive in Wales. We have a different exam board, if you're teaching at a secondary level. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that that's not a barrier to people continuing to do that. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message\u2014 and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train\u2014that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "So, you'll still be recruiting on the basis of skills and adaptability and so on."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, of course."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got a lot of issues to cover, so I'm going to appeal for concise questions, concise answers. On to assessment, progression and accountability\u2014Suzy."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. We've set the scene. What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Excellent, concise question. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Well, the principles were broadly supported, Suzy. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment\u2014we refer to a formative and summative assessment\u2014and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. But, generally, supported."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. That's a good concise answer as well."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Yes, well done."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be\u2014. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document\u2014is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh, yes. And that should be the purpose for assessment. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Right. I accept that. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent\u2014I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive\u2014inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. We only have to look at the debacle around BTEC science to know that."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. I understand that. So, how\u2014? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line\u2014the methodology\u2014is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "To accountability?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "To accountability. Well, we're moving to a system of schools as learning organisations, and a greater emphasis on self-evaluation, with external verification of that by Estyn, our inspectors."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "And that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well\u2014will those indicators change, do you think?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, categorisation\u2014again, the purpose for categorisation is not to make a judgment on a school in the sense of a league table; it's a triage process, categorisation."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "It's how it seen, though, sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, this is the issue, isn't it? This is the problem of designing a system where there are perfectly good reasons to introduce the system\u2014and in this case it's a triage system to identify levels of support for a school. But then others come along and turn it into something else that it was never intended to be. And categorisation was never intended to be a way of expressing a league table of school performances; it's there to identify levels of support that a school can expect from its regional consortia. Now, we have, we have\u2014we will continue to keep categorisation, but, since coming into office, we have tried to adapt categorisation simply away from pure data to a more formative assessment process, and categorisation will continue to evolve. The message is very clear: this is not to absolve our system of accountability. And the first level of accountability in that system has to be the professionalism of an individual member of staff\u2014the moral purpose that I bring to my classroom today to do right by the children that are in front of me. That's the first level of our accountability, and therefore we have our new teaching standards. As a leader, we have new leadership standards. That's the first part of our accountability regime\u2014the moral purpose our professionals bring to their work. So, categorisation will stay. Will it evolve? Yes, because it's been evolving over the last three years. This is about better accountability, smarter accountability, not less accountability."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Well, just finally on that, there may be an argument, then, for scrapping categorisation, putting something else in place. But I suppose the core question is: how are the general public going to understand all those things that you've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach, the leaders being able to lead, and how well a school is performing against KPIs on those measures?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, because we will still\u2014. We will still have inspections, won't we?"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. So, it's all going to go in through the Estyn reports. This is the kind of detail I'm after."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, that's the ultimate, isn't it? So, the ultimate is\u2014. The ultimate system that we're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in Estyn. But it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff. That's where it starts, and it ends in Estyn."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. Will you just let me have this one?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Go on, then."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "I don't think I've quite followed that journey. Because I get the point of the end point being Estyn, and that's where the public assurance will be seen, but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards? Where will we see those demonstrated?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, you would expect to see those demonstrated in the self-evaluation that a school will provide of itself, and then Estyn\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "All right, so schools will be publishing self-evaluations annually, or something like that?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, schools\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "The outcome of the self-evaluation is a school development plan. We expect those to be considerably enhanced."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And available."}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. We expect that to be published through the school website, so the outcomes of that. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures\u2014just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. It's broadening the evidence base. The school is evaluating\u2014the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. Within the plan, they will have a set area of priorities that they will be publishing."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "And the schools' ability\u2014whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well\u2014will be judged by Estyn."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. That's really helpful."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. So, we've got some questions on specific areas. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think\u2014yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago\u2014will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. How is awareness and understanding of human rights, including children\u2019s rights, being embedded in the new curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Children's rights, human rights\u2014they've been key considerations throughout the design, and this is currently set out in overarching guidance and we continue to work with the children's commissioner's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience. And I'm delighted that the children's commissioner took the time to write to me during the feedback phase to say that they were very pleased that their initial assessment demonstrates that what we're proposing is a big step forward."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. And how do you respond to the concerns expressed in the children's commissioner\u2019s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Turning to the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And this proposal by the Learned Society will be considered as part of that work."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have to support the Welsh dimension are really, really, really broad and not confined to specific areas. I was in Swansea University just this week, looking at some of their Technocamp work that they're doing to help us with coding, and we had an amazing conversation about the Welsh contribution to the computing industry. And so my expectation is that that isn't taught in a history lesson\u2014that, actually, when children are learning about coding, they get to hear that Welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology. So, that's\u2014. When I talk about a Welsh dimension, I mean right the way across the curriculum, and I think that's important. With regard to\u2014. The continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught. We have to recognise\u2014. We have to recognise that, and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa\u2014we've had this discussion before\u2014if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. It isn't a start and never get any further."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay, so it's the timing."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, for me."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, later on, maybe when this is embedded\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I get that. That's why I don't understand why we're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the PISA. But, I understand."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "There could well be a different decision, but for 2021 we're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with. I just don't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system. The very opposite is true. We are seen as exemplars by the OECD\u00a0and some of the work that's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "So, you'll think about it for the next round of PISA."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Oh gosh, that shows that Si\u00e2n thinks that I'll be here to make that decision. [Laughter.] That's very encouraging indeed. [Laughter.]"}, {"speaker": "Steve Davies", "content": "One very quick technical point, Chair. We have not opted out of this. Countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it, and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Janet, you've got a question on physical activity."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Can you give a guarantee that all children and young people, where appropriate, will take part in physical activity under the new curriculum for Wales? Also, how much time per week will the Government expect children and young people to spend undertaking physical activity?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, all children will be given that opportunity, because if they are not then that school would be in breach of the expectations that will be set out in statute."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "How will you monitor it?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Again, Janet, I don't go around monitoring schools now."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "No, but through the systems and mechanisms in place."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, of course. As we've just said\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "How will you ensure that every child has that opportunity?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Well, as we've just said, ultimately, we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia, nor are we getting rid of Estyn. So, one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that Estyn would make to a school."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Suzy, you've got a question on early years."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Yes. To what extent will the new curriculum allow for the continuity of the way that the foundation phase is taught? Will there be any significant differences and have the early years professionals been involved in the development of the curriculum to date?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, early years professionals have been involved in the curriculum to date. One of the advantages, I think, of the new curriculum is to take the pedagogical principles that underpin our approach to early years education actually further into children's educational journey. I'm sure, Suzy, that you've had conversations that\u2014. We have a certain pedagogical approach until the age of seven, and then all of a sudden, at seven, it's like, 'Forget all of that now. Sit down, pick up your pen and do this.' That's been really uncomfortable for many practitioners in our primary sector. So, actually, yes, statutory and non-statutory provision have been involved in the development of the curriculum because, of course, some of this is going to be delivered in the non-statutory sector. I'm very welcoming and supportive of that, but those pedagogical principles will now be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, that's really important. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. So, colleagues in FE have been part of this process throughout. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around what qualifications will look like, I was very keen to take the opportunity to emphasise that any changes to qualifications should be a gateway to further study in FE, whichever type of route the child took. But FE have been involved in this process from the very beginning."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "And you're confident they're geared up to accepting young people who have been educated in this way."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Yes, absolutely. FE continues to be one of the real strengths of our education system."}, {"speaker": "Suzy Davies AM", "content": "Okay, that's great, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got a question now on governance arrangements. Suzy, you're down to do that one\u2014sorry, Si\u00e2n."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "I think you actually answered this at the beginning, but just to confirm that you're carrying on with the same governance set-up, the different groups that you've got, and there's nothing being added there or taken away."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "No."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. And just finally from me, then, on pupil referral units: what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation?"}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Okay. So, we've been taking advice from Brett Pugh, who chairs the education otherwise than at school improvement group, and this has been an area where we've had to think really, really, really, really, really hard. So, what we intend to do for EOTAS and PRU is to set a minimum of what we would expect a child to receive. So, that would be around the four purposes; that would be around the cross-cutting themes of literacy, numeracy and digital competency and health and well-being. So, that would be the baseline of our expectation, that every pupil would get that. After that, then there needs to be a discussion and a focus on what is in the best interests of that particular pupil. One of the things we know about sometimes in EOTAS is we have very able and talented students who don't get access to the range of qualifications and courses that they have the capability and the aptitude to do. We also have to consider, though, that for some children they may be out of school for reasons, and telling them that they've got to do a full curriculum may be hugely detrimental to their mental health and well-being. So, for instance, to give an example, you could have a child who's very ill, and saying to them, 'You have to carry the full load of a curriculum' could be inappropriate. So, we'll be setting a minimum standard, as I said, around the purposes, around the cross-cutting themes and health and well-being, and then there will be an expectation that in conjunction with the child and the family an appropriate addition would be put in place to meet the needs of that child, recognising that they could have very different needs. Is that clear?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Well, yes, and it's something that we'll probably look to build on when we look at our inquiry on EOTAS, which is coming up. Thank you. That concludes our questions. We've covered a lot of ground. So, can I thank you for attending and thank your officials for coming today? As usual, we will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again, all of you, for your attendance this morning."}, {"speaker": "Kirsty Williams AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Item 3 then is papers to note. As Members will see, there are a substantial number of papers to note\u201423 in total, which are in a supplementary pack. As there are so many, can I suggest that we note them all together and then we've got an opportunity to return to some of them in the private session afterwards? Is that okay with everybody? Okay. Thank you. Item 4 then. Can I propose in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting? Are Members content?"}]}

Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't {disfmarker} that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls .

Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "to find out .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , it's it's no it's not a {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but that's th mm {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's what Paul says .

Um {disfmarker} Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh {disfmarker} Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh {disfmarker} And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because infrared is not visible .

Are you almost finished or just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because I was short on time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No worry ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more .

Wh what's that ? So uh {disfmarker} Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are .

Um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty .

Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , that's {disfmarker} It changes things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm sorry about that .

I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That still stays ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "That's important I think and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ah {disfmarker} I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .

Is that reachable maybe ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I didn't read {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That's very {disfmarker} That's fancy . That's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's very fashion ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I didn't read any"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Twelve and you've got twelve ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "b Yeah . Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I I know ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Only the numbers , only numbers .

I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ?

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah yeah , one level .

Well then then we're gonna put it in ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , just {vocalsound} {gap} {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you {gap} other functions ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe that's better . Yeah , that's that's a very good point ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Think that's better ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? {gap}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{gap} No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so that's {disfmarker} Uh I'll just have a look how much that is ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} The {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But um {disfmarker} Okay , for the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I I think so . I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ah okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Good ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you can show your prototype if you want to ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Together ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , it's {disfmarker} Let's do it together ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I'll give comments ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners .

Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and Hefin David, and we've got no substitutions. Can I ask if Members have any declarations of interest? Can I just, then, declare for the record that I chair the cross-party group on suicide prevention and that Samaritans Cymru, who are appearing before us later, provide the secretariat for that group, just for that to be on the record? Item 2, then, is an evidence session for our inquiry on education otherwise than at school, and I'm very pleased to welcome our panel of witnesses this morning: Sharon Davies, head of learning, Torfaen County Borough Council and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; Nick Williams, director of education, Swansea city and county council, and representing the Association of Directors of Education in Wales; and David Hopkins, interim head of education at the Welsh Local Government Association. Thank you very much, all of you, for attending. We've got a lot of ground we'd like to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay.\u00a0And if I can just start by asking you what you believe the main reasons are for the increase in the number of exclusions from school."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "I'll start, if that's okay. I think one of the things we're experiencing across the system in Wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour. I think the prevalence of ASD\u2014autism spectrum disorder\u2014and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge. Obviously, I can speak more about my own local authority in Swansea: the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five, six years, so what's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well, and the system's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that, so that is placing pressure on schools and then, in turn, pressure on the EOTAS, including our pupil referral units, because, obviously, we just probably haven't got enough capacity at the moment in the system."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Anybody got anything to add to that, or\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "No, I think that's what we're seeing in Torfaen as well. I'd second that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. So, to what extent, then, do local authorities have clear strategies for support and reintegration, and a continuum of provision to meet the needs of learners who are either at risk of exclusion, or disengagement?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Well, we've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy, which, with our schools\u2014and I'm aware, because I work in the south-west and mid Wales region, and I know some of the other local authorities have something similar, and, similarly, I chair the EOTAS network across Wales, and I know many local authorities are going in that direction, so that has a tiered approach, or staged approach, or whichever, so that there's universal provision. I think it's something that\u2014you know, we need to make sure that our staff and our schools are well-equipped to meet these needs, but there will always, unfortunately, be some learners who need more specialist provision. So, it's equipping them with those sorts of skills, really. I think it's certainly moved forward from where we were two of three years ago. But there's a little bit of lag in the system, trying to bring everybody up to the same, consistent level. But I think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities, as far as I'm aware."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "When we're looking at the accountabilities, there's a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some\u2014. There is a shift in that culture. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that having a knock-on effect on our learners, because, undoubtedly, there are pressures on schools."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "So, you've seen an improvement since the capped 9 has been brought in?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I think it's early to say,\u00a0but certainly we're working towards that improvement. I can only speak for Torfaen\u2014we've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced, and accounts for every learner within the system."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "May I answer this in Welsh?"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Of course, yes."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "The messages that the Government is conveying to us and the messages we convey as directors and councils are important as well. So, we always tell them that it's the progression of the children in the future that's important, not just reaching up to the level. So, it's more complex than that, and it's important to share that. And in fairness to Estyn\u2014Estyn has changed its mind as well. So, messages such as those are being conveyed now, and I think that the schools do understand now the expectation and what's expected of them."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. In terms of parents, what are local authorities doing to actually engage parents of children and young people who are either EOTAS or at risk of becoming EOTAS?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "I'll answer this in English. Again, I know perhaps Swansea\u00a0and Neath Port Talbot\u2014we have a team-around-the-family approach. So, as you say, it's more complicated than just the child behaving in a certain way, or being school-anxious, whatever the issue is. So, it's sort of bringing all of the agencies together to try and look at how we can proactively solve problems and support the families. Because nearly always, the behaviours that are demonstrated, or come out in schools, or whatever provision, is obviously probably greater in the home environment, so there's a whole\u2014. We understand the complexities and the need for a whole-family, almost, approach to support."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I would say the majority have."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Yes, it's quite common practice. As Nick mentioned, it is about that multi-agency approach\u2014it is working with social care, working with health colleagues, to look at the whole package that goes into these families and to our learners."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Certainly with schools, I know across Wales we've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice, so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through, whereas in the past\u2014I'm thinking myself, now, as a teacher\u2014they were just difficult behaviours. I didn't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through. So, I think we are more informed as a profession."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking\u2014? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding\u2014they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Yes."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, certainly."}, {"speaker": "Sian Hughes", "content": "What is your experience, then?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training\u2014perhaps more than staff in the school sector?' And in fairness, they have addressed that, but perhaps it's not at the forefront of their minds when they're thinking of providing funding to the schools. So, it's a little bit of an afterthought. But this will be needed in the future, certainly."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And maybe I can ask the WLGA: are the difficulties that can arise between the money that is kept back by local authorities and the funding that goes directly to schools\u2014can that therefore affect the kind of provision that's happening from authority to authority?"}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "Yes, sure. The delegation levels are already very high in most authority areas, and we've got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money, or as much money as possible, is devolved to schools. So, I don't think that's a direct factor. I think the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that\u2014sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure\u2014there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Okay. But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "It shouldn't, but it could. It's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react. If they're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures, they will react in a particular way. Culturally, we've got to get to the point, I think, particularly with the new curriculum coming in, where we say, 'Look, forget the narrow measures that you're being judged by. We're trying to agree with partners, including Estyn and the Welsh Government, a broader range of measures.' That, in a sense, may provide opportunities for schools, and local authorities, to look more constructively at this whole area. So, that's one area, but you're right, I think the ALN legislation will put pressures on, not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because we're talking now about a wider age range\u2014doing up to 25 as well. So, we've got a host of issues, I think, there to consider and work our way through."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And is the fact that there's variation from term to term, from week to week sometimes, in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools\u2014is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge, and maybe that that leads to more exclusions?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "As you say, because it changes, it's difficult then to plan ahead, and from year to year and also, as you've said, within the term. Perhaps you have provision for more learners coming in or moving, and then that causes the pressure within the system, then, because you haven't planned for them, and therefore there's no spare funding there to draw on."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Also, in fairness to PRUs, we've been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them. We don't want a lag in the system, because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding."}, {"speaker": "Sian Hughes", "content": "Okay, thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools,\u00a0PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important\u2014. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools, and vice versa, particularly around the curriculum. And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other\u2014sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band B, we're building a brand-new PRU provision in Swansea, which will be open in January 2021. So, we've recognised that, so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools. There's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school, and we continue to support them during that process. But then, when they're back in school, that support doesn't stop\u2014that support continues, and then there's a managed reduction in that support. And that's proven very successful."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "It sounds to me very\u2014. Yes, good\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "But I'll be honest with you, the more challenging your learners are the ones who are coming to the end of their statutory education, your key stage 4. It is far, far more difficult when they're 15, 16 to get them back into mainstream. So, then you're looking more at how you transit, then, into further education and colleges and so on."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. Thank you. In your view\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before we move on, have you got anything to add, Sharon, in terms of\u2014? Because, obviously, we've had the Swansea perspective. I mean, how effective are Torfaen at reintegrating young people into mainstream education?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "As Nick said, it does get more difficult at key stage 4, and it's working, then, with\u2014. It comes back to that team-around-the-family approach, to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school, what can the school provide. It's looking at the whole package of support, then, that surrounds not just the learner but the family, whether it's transport\u2014it's looking at the whole agenda, then, to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school, where it's possible."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "I think, Chair, at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting, but it's early days yet for looking at that. I mean, that's an ideal, obviously, but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully, and it brings\u2014. The principle is fine, but it does bring a host of other issues with it, if you see what I mean. But it's certainly a model worth looking at. It's been tried elsewhere, and we keep an eye on that, but we don't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "And which authority is that?"}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "I don't think I'm allowed to say at this point."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Oh, okay. And where is it being tried elsewhere? In England, is it?"}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "Oxfordshire."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "A few years ago, I used to be a primary headteacher in England, so we were looking at different models, then, at various conferences, and I believe Oxford, as a local authority\u2014they had a PRU, and they had discussions with their secondary schools, then, whether to get rid of the PRU, as such, and give the money back into schools. But they looked at a partnership within the schools, then, to say, 'Okay, you can have the money, but there's got to be terms of reference'\u2014not quite a service level agreement, but the schools worked together as a partnership, then, so that they couldn't keep moving the children around, the learners around. It's looking at how well that worked. It started off really well, but that was a few years ago, so I don't know whether it's continued now. But that was a model that, at the time, that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools, then, to have that responsibility\u2014that they didn't offload the learners elsewhere."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Nick, you wanted to\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, sorry. We do something similar in Swansea. We've operated this now for almost three years, where we devolve\u2014the word is 'devolve', as opposed to 'delegate'\u2014the money to secondary schools to try and give them some extra resource to manage the process, and they have to produce an action plan, which we monitor, about how they're using that funding. But, obviously, we recognise that\u2014and it's back to your original question, the first question\u2014we still have learners, unfortunately, despite pretty effective support and provision in nearly all our schools, because of the very, very challenging behaviour we're experiencing, who do need additional and bespoke support, which in fairness the school can't provide. So, it's a mixed economy, if you like, in Swansea."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Janet."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. So, in your view, though, what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing EOTAS\u00a0provision?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Capacity\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "What? Sorry, I missed that."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Sorry. Capacity: we just haven't got enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. Obviously, given what I've said as well, and I'm sure it'd be the same for all local authorities, we've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if you like, the home school. So, there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable, which isn't ideal, I accept, but again, it's working with the families and the youngsters. Also, for us as well we've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners. Sometimes, it works really well; sometimes, the learner turns around and says, 'Actually, I preferred it in my old school.' So, there's a cooling-off period as well. I think the learner voice is very important there, because\u2014. We've got to have a package, I think, that is quite wide in its offer."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. What would be the advantages or disadvantages, then, of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers, and for EOTAS providers to have approved status?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Obviously, we do do that, but we're struggling sometimes for additional provision\u2014very important around safeguarding. However, we don't want to make it too difficult, so that we haven't got any providers coming forward either. So, it's a little bit of a balancing act. But, first and foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision\u2014what sort of training and support they have. At the moment, that is a struggle for us, because we're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is\u2014. But, to actually offer some additional training is a challenge."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. To what extent do local authorities know about the level of EOTAS provision that is organised by individual schools, whether in an FE college or otherwise off the school site?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "The schools would have to make sure that\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "But is that happening, do you know?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, because schools do take safeguarding very, very seriously. They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP\u2014Torfaen curriculum panel\u2014which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past\u2014it's about keeping that momentum going."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Can I just ask what you mean by individual tuition?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual, I would assume that means."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Okay."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "I wouldn't like to think anyone was falling through\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "I think the purpose of the question is around home tuition, yes."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes. Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Well, I appreciate that, and that's the\u2014[Inaudible.]"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families invite us in there's very little\u2014. We are restricted in that respect."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "What about if they're in a private setting?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "If they're following a restricted timetable or whatever, because maybe they're school anxious and so on, and we're trying to get them into our provision like that, the home-tuition staff work for us. We don't use agency staff, for instance, to go in and provide a few hours of provision, or to go to the local library. So, for whatever reason their needs at the moment can't be met in a school or in approved provision, then the staff who do provide some education, or if it's for medical reasons, they work for us in the local authority. So, we're not using\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Is that widespread around Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "We're very similar to that."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly. I think your question is probably about other forms of provision and how do you quality assure those."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Absolutely, yes."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "And that's more difficult to answer, I suspect."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "What we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority, but I think Nick has answered that now, really, if that's a consistent answer for local authorities.\u00a0Can I just ask, before we move on, in the WLGA paper, you say you're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are EOTAS and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working'. Can you expand on those concerns for the committee?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "I think it's, you know\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "It was the WLGA paper, actually."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "It was a joint paper. You go on."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "It's about getting that money following the learner and so on, and that shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep, because we want them reintegrated back into schools\u2014that's the aim of any provision that we put in. It's not permanent\u2014except, for certain learners, that might be the case\u2014so they're still, if you like, part and parcel of the school. I think one of your other colleagues asked about the off-rolling, if you like\u2014another term that's used\u2014of students when they get to GCSEs\u00a0so they don't count in schools' data. We're trying to very much move away from that, through the messages that we all give our schools. The messages that governors and headteachers then give to their staff. So: 'They're our learners. They're the most vulnerable learners we've got.' And for the individuals, for the families, and for society, if we can't support these learners\u2014we know the links then to crime, and the cost to us as a society as well. So, it's in all our interests to do the very best for these learners."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "You won't get any arguments from us on that. Si\u00e2n Gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. I just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands, and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum, of course. What are the challenges? I'll begin with the WLGA, in general, and ask you, in both your areas, what are the challenges to ensure that EOTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?"}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "In general terms\u2014. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer. I couldn't give you a definitive one of what's happening across Wales. My colleagues can probably tell you what's happening in their localities, and that would be helpful. But in general: PRUs, yes, we'd be satisfied; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority, yes, we would be satisfied; other areas, we would not be able to give a definitive answer on, is my guess."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And does that worry you?"}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "Me?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "The WLGA."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "Of course it's a concern. If you can't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person, it is a concern."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "In the region, we do collaborate with each other in terms of staff training. Certainly, they also work with school staff as well. So, the developments are quite positive currently, but there is work to do, I agree."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "In terms of the how curriculum is at present, are you happy that it's being delivered?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "To be honest, we are\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "In the PRUs?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "To be honest, they are broad and balanced. They have to be broad and balanced currently. But there's working together now in terms of the new curriculum, and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Collaboration, I think, is the answer, between the PRUs and the schools. Collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners have what they need."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. I can see how collaborative working with the units can work\u2014because they're under your control\u2014the problem is the other parts of the system, in a way."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "They're not with other people all the time; they just go for something So, they would still have literacy and numeracy and Welsh\u2014that would still be provided in the PRU. So, they're not out all the time."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "No, it's beyond the PRUs I'm talking about. If a pupil is in a PRU, you are telling me that they have the curriculum. But for those who are in homes, or in private provision, perhaps who are not in your experience\u2014. Maybe, this morning, we're getting a picture of the best practice, and we're not going under the surface to where things aren't as good in some areas. Do you agree that there is that inconsistency? What we're hearing about now are the best elements."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Consistency is developing across Wales."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "With the curriculum?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, and in terms of collaboration. I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it is developing."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you, Si\u00e2n. Questions now from Dawn Bowden."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. It's really around support. It follows on a little bit from what Si\u00e2n was saying. Can I also just refer back to the point that David was making earlier on about ALN and the extent to which ALN support is available to learners in EOTAS? The information that we've had is that it's difficult enough in mainstream schools, but in an EOTAS setting, it's particularly challenging. So, how can that be improved? What can we do to address that? The reason I'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an EOTAS setting\u2014that's why they're there, quite often. So, it's almost more important that that ALN provision follows them through."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "If a child has additional needs, of course they should be met, whatever the setting. But I take your point. There's a possibility that\u2014. Again, going back to the previous question, we would know within, say a PRU or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition\u2014whatever form that took\u2014then those needs definitely should be being met. I can't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but they should be. Once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system, then, again, if a child has a particular need, of course that need should be met, but it becomes increasingly difficult. So, I think there possibly is an issue there, but I don't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that. But there certainly may well be an issue there."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "There is a disconnect between what should be happening and what actually is happening, isn't there? Even in some local authority PRUs where we expect all of this to be happening, we know that it\u2019s not; we know that the full curriculum is not being provided either. The basic numeracy, literacy and well-being stuff is taking place, but there is discrepancy of provision, even in local authority commissioned EOTAS provision."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "I think there will be variations in provision, but I would say that, within the local authority maintained sector, that provision should be being made. If it's not, the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "We've probably\u2014[Inaudible.]\u2014in Swansea if you look at the inspections of the provision. Going back some years, they weren't\u2014 What you're describing, it was true. However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got the capacity because of the demands on us from the wider system."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And\u2014. Sorry, go on."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "It's kind of what Nick said about capacity, but it's also ensuring the right staff as well, because sometimes, you may have them, but if they move on, or retire, or whatever, there's not a bus load, if you like, of people with that expertise. Because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise, and therefore, it's quite niche, and once that person has moved on, it's really difficult to start all over again."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I understand that."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Absolutely. It's more than just one person\u2014it's the whole training package that goes around that capacity as well."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, and I'll come back to that in a moment."}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "But I think that's something we could do better. I think we need to be more\u2014. Because that's not just down to money, it's making sure that we perhaps offer, through our teacher training colleges, the opportunity for them to spend some time. At the moment, a newly qualified teacher can't work in this type of provision, which you can argue, that's fine, they need to perhaps get mainstream first. But we need a group of people in the future to fill those gaps. So, that should be built in to their teacher training, and even through their ongoing professional development, both ways\u2014staff actually coming out to schools, going into our provision and vise versa\u2014because you can also get very isolated if you've worked in PRUs for\u2014. You've got very specialist skills, but you perhaps need those wider experiences as well. So, we could be doing more there, and I think that's probably, the group I chair, a discussion we need to have."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And on that point, actually, we did hear from Estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision. There really isn't the capacity for them to access professional training. Is that your experience? And if so, what can we do about that?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I think it's limited. I think it is getting better, as Nick mentioned. There are networks now, there are conferences. It is an improving picture, but I think it's limited."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, okay. So, is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of EOTAS?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Yes, but again, it's a capacity issue, because if we take them out of the provision, it's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands. So, it's not an easy conundrum."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "No. But you're saying, really, take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting. I understand that."}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Or whether there's an opportunity, if somebody wants to lead into that more, that there's an opportunity to do it; that there's an offer there, if they want to specialise more into that area. But at the minute, there isn't that option."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Can I just take you back to pupil support? We talked about ALN. What about access to mental health services? What's your experience of EOTAS learners' access to mental health support?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Again, even in the region there's variation there because we've got three health boards over the footprint of the south-west and mid Wales region. So, it varies. That's my understanding, anyway, and I think that's similar across Wales. Ours hasn't been great, to be honest with you. And that's one of the positive steps, that health boards have to have a DECLO\u00a0now\u2014don't ask me, I can't remember what the exact abbreviation is\u2014but we've met with the designated education clinical lead officer, and I think those partnerships will be strong in the future. But it's also us then having a well-being strategy and support that is universal. So, there's counselling and so on to make sure that the learners are going through, if you like\u2014. Not that we're trying to stop them going through, but we're trying to deal with them appropriately at the different stages so that they're not inundated either."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Yes, of course. But is your experience also that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could potentially be leading to more learners ending up in an EOTAS provision."}, {"speaker": "David Hopkins", "content": "I was going to say, about the question, I think there's a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services, for example. I'm not criticising the services, I'm just saying the capacity isn't there, as we would like. So, I think there's probably a more general issue there that would, in turn, translate into pupils who've got additional needs, whether they're in EOTAS, PRU or wherever. I suspect\u2014I've not got an evidence base to offer you, but there's a very long-standing problem there."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Si\u00e2n, you had a supplementary."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Yes. Just to return to teacher training, and you say that new teachers can't go straight into a unit, and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect. But generally speaking, if there's an increase in challenging behaviour, are new teachers able\u2014? They don't have the experience, but are they equipped well enough to deal with that? Because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour, and again, I wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that. And we need\u2014not just in this aspect\u2014but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour. Do you know what I'm saying?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "It's not just\u2014. If people decide not to go into teaching after having training, it's not just because of challenging behaviour. There is a change now. There is more time for students in schools, so that helps. You need the theory, but also the practice\u2014that's important to have somebody who can mentor you in the school and that shows good practice. Then there are the policies that the school uses to assure that there is consistency across the whole school."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "But if we're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people, then it creates a great big challenge, doesn't it? We're looking at something very limited here, but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening. Would you agree with that?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "Yes, certainly."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Sharon, the CAMHS in-reach project is operational in Gwent,\u00a0but my understanding is that they don't include PRUs. Is that right?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I don't know if that is the\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, that's fine, that's my understanding. I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs?"}, {"speaker": "Sharon Davies", "content": "I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what the overall impact is. I think it's early days, but it seems to be positive."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Janet, I think some of the areas have been covered. Is there anything you want to pick up from the\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Yes, I think the rural aspect\u2014are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for EOTAS learners, particularly in more rural parts or areas of Wales?"}, {"speaker": "Nick Williams", "content": "Certainly, in our region, in Powys, from north Powys, when you're almost in Oswestry, down to Ystradgynlais, which is not far from me.

Can I thank you for your attendance this morning? We will send you a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you again for attending. The committee will break until 10:20, but can Members not shoot off for a sec, please? Okay, can I welcome everybody back to our next evidence session, which is our sixth evidence session for our inquiry on education otherwise than at school? I'm very pleased to welcome Sarah Stone, executive director for Wales of Samaritans; Liz Williams, policy and communications officer at Samaritans; and Dr Ian Johnson, who is the manager of children and young people's mental health at Mind Cymru. Thank you all for attending. If it's okay, we'll go straight and questions. If I can just start by asking you what you think the main reasons are why we are seeing this increase in the numbers of children and young people being excluded from school."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "I think you were going to\u2014."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I think it's a very difficult subject, because, in many cases, we're not really sure what the data looks like. We get these things from quite a broad perspective, and we don't actually see the extent of the reasons why. If you look at, for example, the statistical release, then you get a sense of why people are being excluded, but they tend to be\u2014. It's a very reductionist discussion, so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour, verbal abuse or physical assaults, but you don't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that. Now, we know that that information exists, because, obviously, schools don't exclude anybody lightly, and I speak as someone who's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools. So, there's a great deal of paper trail, but that doesn't seem to really find its way up to a higher level."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. And how concerned are you about the trend that we're seeing of an increase in younger children being excluded, and what do you think the reasons might be for that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I think it's very concerning that we're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular. Those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years, and a lot of the evidence that we're hearing is quite anecdotal, so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues, and there's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's\u2014. So, there's a better understanding of that, but I'm not in a position at the moment, really, to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "What I would say is that the reason that Samaritans did our report on exclusions from school rested with\u2014. They began with anecdotal information coming through to us around individual distress and from projects working with young people who'd been excluded. And there are projects that are working with young people who are being excluded\u2014I mean primary school children. And the major thing we say in our report is that we\u2014. So, this is enough to ask us some serious questions, to which we don't know the answer, unless we actually do some serious work on this. So, I would reiterate what we say in our report: that we need to examine this. It's a really important issue, and the life trajectory of those young people is being impacted by their exclusion."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. You may not be able to answer this, but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "Well, I think it's very interesting, looking at Estyn's pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a strong impact: around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11, but you're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9, year 9/year 10. So, I think it's clear that there's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11, but what I think is concerning for me is the normalisation, throughout the system, at secondary school level, where there's off-rolling between year 7/8, year 8/9. Based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort, then you're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year, and I think we need to understand why that is the norm, what could be done around that, as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. The Estyn work is quite factual. It's looking at the numbers. I think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there's a specific reason why schools are doing that, related to the accountability measures. It'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera, but I think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that's currently available."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "I think there's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable. So, I suppose, if you consider that, this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps aren't attaining brilliant grades. So, I think that's something that needs to be looked at further."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "And, just finally, if that's okay, just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy, to which we made extensive representations on this issue. A part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools. So, that is a commitment in that strategy. It's a really important commitment to make a reality of that, because, actually, what is happening, I think, is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "Could I just come in on that? I think there's an interesting, again, qualitative, quantitative, element to what happens to those children who move into PRU,\u00a0EOTAS provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career. So, I think there's a question, then, about\u2014I was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8, 8/9, et cetera, and how they loop back into the mainstream education system, what happens to them, but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into EOTAS, PRU provision, and what happens to those young people afterwards? I'm sure we'll pick up some of that as we go through."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders around the support for learners who are at risk of becoming EOTAS."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Good morning. To what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming EOTAS?"}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "Okay. So, this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did, and we came up with a range of suggestions. I think the quick answer is that what we've seen is a strong indication that it isn't, and that it's\u2014. But also that it's not simply a question of the young person, that it's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing. So, there are a couple of big things to say on this one. One is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people\u2014and that distress may show in a number of ways, not necessarily just as obvious distress. So, I think it's understanding that, having a confident response and, obviously, this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well, which may not come out in exactly that way\u2014but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts. And I think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences, and if you see the young person\u2014. I think what we as Samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual\u2014that's what we do, it's what we're majorly about. So, a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way, perhaps. That school may also be their only safe place, and I think that's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering. Hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this, a lot of them are very aware of that, and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person. There are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in Cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring. I've heard\u2014. There's been so much interest in this piece of work that we've done, and I've spoken to many educators since, and so it's doing what we needed to do, which is to get people talking about it. Because I think it's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support, it is understanding that it's a whole-school question. It's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of Wales, joining that up and making that much more general. So, I think that's the opportunity: is to really recognise that this is a big issue, and that, if you don't hold young people within an educational setting, the lifetime consequences for them, including their elevated risk of suicide\u2014it's very hard to reverse that. So, I think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that, and it's amazing to move someone on from where they started, and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they've done that and how they've felt that's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they're subjected to."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I think it's an issue where it's very important both to focus on the individual, but also on the macro situation, and, as Sarah mentioned, I think the whole-school approach, which is something that's been discussed within this committee, as part of the 'Mind over matter' work, is something that is hugely important. And that's why that should be\u2014there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach. Because understanding\u2014. That prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will, hopefully, be very effective in providing support levels, ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning, all the way through primary school, all the way through secondary school, to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that's at the forefront of people's considerations whenever they're considering what a pupil is doing, and why they might be doing it. And that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences. But, generally, just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first, I think, is hugely important in this context."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Okay. And what do you think could be done more, and by whom, to help schools to support pupils to remain in mainstream education?"}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "So, this is where we set out nine recommendations in our report and I think the major message is, as I said before, that we don't have a simple answer to this one. However, there are a number of things that we need to do: we need to recognise the impact of adverse childhood experiences; we need to train teachers so that they have an understanding response and are much more confident in that; we need to learn from what works; we need to listen to the voices of young people themselves. That's terribly important, because\u2014. I know this committee is very well aware of that, because you've done very good work listening to the direct voices of young people, but they are very often able to articulate quite a lot about what is needed. I would also add to that that we would want young people themselves to be skilled up in understanding and recognising their own emotions, because this is about putting in place that awareness, that consciousness, if you like, about being able to name and recognise feelings. There's great international evidence on the importance of that and the benefit of it, which was carried out when the new curriculum was being developed, and the health aspect of that. So, we've kind of done that work in Wales. What we would like to see is that new curriculum around health and well-being and mental health and awareness being in the curriculum, so that young people, on a statutory basis\u2014. Otherwise, you're entrenching the differences and the inequalities between teaching across Wales, because the good will do it, and perhaps others will find it much harder. So, that's a major message as well. So, I think there's a menu, if you like, and some of it is very much about respecting the experience of teachers and of schools and working with them, because this is about working with their will to do things well."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I think what's important, and maybe it's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools, is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person. So, that has to be taken deeply into consideration. Obviously, the schools provide whatever support they can, but what is the best for the young person at this time? And that answer will differ from individual to individual. I think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this, and it's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this. One of the projects that Mind will be working on in Wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry, where we'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence, because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal, and I think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel, and how they find this. Sarah's referred to the curriculum. I think there's a lot to be done, still, with regard to PRU and EOTAS with the new curriculum, and, hopefully, we'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. And what are your views on the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support, because I know that the Samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support? How can the balance be addressed?"}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "I think it's a really difficult balance, but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report. So, we held a round table during the research period, and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs. And, obviously, this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups. And they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp, or not properly diagnosed, and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and, again, these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded. So, when you consider that, you tend to think, actually, diagnosis could be really useful, so that staff are aware of the pupil's needs, and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour. However, what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child's condition or additional learning needs, and that the proper support was there, then diagnosis alone wasn't of value. So, I think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need, so, again, if the support isn't there, that child isn't going to benefit from diagnosis. And what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive, and for that child, regardless of whether they had an additional learning need or not, to have proper opportunity to progress."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you. And, then, to what extent are schools aware of the impact of early trauma ACEs, and how are schools adapting their practices to take account of them?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I don't think we're really capable of saying that on an individual level. We're aware, as you've heard from previous evidence from heads of education, et cetera, directors of education, that work is going on on an all-Wales basis, and there's obviously an awful lot of work that's going on on the ACEs agenda. I referred to being a previous school governor, and that's somewhere that's become a trauma-informed school, and they have established that and are widening that base. I think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back, as I said, with the curriculum changes as we're going forward. There's a concern that I have at the moment regarding the progress on EOTAS and PRU within the new curriculum, and there's work that I think will still need to be done, and something that I'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment Bill when it comes forward later on in the year, because there were comments made by the education Minister, I think, in response to Suzy Davies, in the statement in January, that we're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner, to which I have no concern in itself. However, the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage. So, the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience, and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum, is hugely important."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "And I think, just to add to that around the impact of early trauma, I think one of the things that we at Samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation. That sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being. We are social beings. And one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity, if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups, is to lead to lifelong isolation. It's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men. You look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years, very often, and Samaritans is about to release some research on that very point. So, there's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here. There's also, if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys, and we're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men\u2014. Again, I think it's important to see this whole picture\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "It's very bad in north Wales. Our figures are very worrying."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "Yes, exactly. So, there's a bigger picture here. I would say that we want to do something to mitigate the impact of adverse childhood experiences, and we have this great opportunity to release the potential of those young people whose, often, strength and resilience is quite extraordinary in circumstances that many of us would find hard to imagine. So, we need to look at the assets that young people have as well, which you can work with. So, I think if there's a real opportunity to create a change, this is one of them. This issue about exclusions and PRUs\u2014this is a chance to make that ambition real."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you so much. Very good."}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "Just to reiterate what Sarah said, looking at our research, which, obviously, isn't yet published but will be soon, it really is quite shocking how these men fell through the net so many times when they were young, and, actually, how many missed opportunities there were to intervene in the cycles of inequality. It is quite clear from that research that these stages where children are demonstrating challenging behaviour are the first signs of distress. So actually, this is where we should be intervening. So, I think like Sarah said, it is really important to see this as a preventative agenda."}, {"speaker": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM", "content": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. Dawn."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Thank you, Chair. A few questions around providing support for learners. You've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report, your nine points and so on, but what's your view on the support currently provided, both in a school setting and EOTAS settings for mental health support? Have you been able to get that sort of information? Have you got a sense of\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I don't think we're really in a position to answer fully as to what's going on. I think that part of the problem is there's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this, and I think that's really why there's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Sure. So much of your evidence is anecdotal, is it? It's people that have been referred to you, come to you for help, and you just\u2014or your own research. What\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "The research that we're going to do is really where we're at, and that's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general. I think, in particular, we're aware of increases\u2014quite substantial increases in some cases\u2014regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools. My experience of projects that I've been involved in\u2014I was previously in front of this committee as part of the Time to Change Wales project\u2014was that, overall, it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment. Where the SMT has taken a lead, then it feels that schools are really doing something. Where the SMT are, perhaps, a bit more laissez-faire regarding this, then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward. And to come back to the point, that's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory, because we'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes, because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I guess the EOTAS or PRU provision is going to be much more challenging then, isn't it, then main school provision. I suppose that was what I was trying to get at as well, whether you get a sense that there may be some progress being made in mainstream schools, is that following through in PRUs and EOTAS provision?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I'll just be honest: right now, I couldn't give you an answer on that. I think that is something that, perhaps, slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues. I would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice. I've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally, but I think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it's done."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "I appreciate you're not educationalists and you wouldn't necessarily have all of that information, but have you got any sense of\u2014again, whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you\u2014evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems? If you've got any evidence of that, what might the impact of that be on the individuals?"}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "Yes, I think that certainly does happen. I suppose we know this anecdotally from Samaritans research, but also I have experience of working in pupil referral units and working with some really vulnerable children, and I think there is a sense sometimes that these children are labelled as naughty and disruptive. So, children who have additional learning needs or a communication problem that potentially is undiagnosed or not really properly understood. I think when children have mental health problems and additional learning needs, often they can find the school environment really difficult. I've worked with children who have told me that they just don't enjoy being in the classroom because they feel incredibly anxious. They don't feel they can contribute to the school environment, they don't feel like they're keeping up with their classmates and, as a result, they demonstrate challenging behaviour so that they can leave the classroom. I think that's very sad. As a result, these children aren't always understood and are off-rolled in some cases. But, like Sarah said earlier, there are certainly examples of really good practice, and I suppose this links in to what approaches schools, pupil referral units and EOTAS should take to vulnerable children with mental health problems. One example I can give you is that, at one pupil referral unit, the children would get really distressed and really disruptive towards the end of the day on a Friday. I suppose that, in some schools, the teachers would have thought, 'This is ridiculous, they're disrupting the lessons', but what the teachers knew is that these children would go home, they would face such adversity, wouldn't always get a meal, would be exposed to things they shouldn't be exposed to, and the teachers were able to respond to that with compassion and empathy. But, obviously, seeing behind behaviour is really, really difficult, and I don't think teachers should have to do this alone, they should be properly trained and properly equipped. Even going up to a child\u2014and I suppose this goes back to mental health support. Ideally, as Samaritans, we would want suicide prevention plans to be embedded in schools and to be part of the culture of schools, but obviously this can't happen if teachers aren't properly equipped and don't have the confidence to go up to a student and ask them if they're struggling. In our compassion in education toolkit, we highlight the importance of asking a child, 'Are you self-harming?', if there are signs; 'Have you tried to take your own life?', if there are signs. But obviously that's a very difficult conversation to have. So, yes, there are certainly examples of best practice, but I do believe that, if school staff aren't properly equipped and trained, off-rolling pupils, especially at key stage 4, where obviously you will hold those grades, is definitely something that they don't necessarily have the incentive to prevent. So it's worth looking at that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "You touched, in the beginning of that response, on children being labelled as naughty. To what extent have you come across that? Is that quite prevalent? Is that quite common?"}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "Absolutely, yes. I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the teacher. I think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support. Lots of children with communication difficulties especially, if they haven't been formally diagnosed, they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty, because I suppose people think, 'Well, you should be doing well, you're bright. You should be thriving in school.' But that's not always the case. Children can be incredibly anxious, have mental health problems, obviously, are exposed to ACEs and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about. So, I think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty', and I think children also play up to that as well. Like I said, if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom, if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space, they will do that."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "And then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need."}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "Absolutely, yes, and I think that's where formal diagnosis can be helpful. I think the doors are open then to much more school support. So, yes, I think it is down to how the school approach it, and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum. It embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school, and it means that students might know when they need help, how to be more resilient and helping themselves, and when and how to ask for help from the teachers. So, I think it's really important."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "If I can just pick up on one of those points, Mind Cymru conducted a series of focus groups around Wales to inform our response to the new curriculum. One of the comments that I think struck home most strongly with me was a young boy saying that, because the same teacher was responsible for pastoral and behaviour, because he had been labelled as naughty or a troublemaker, he felt uncomfortable in terms of going to that same person within the school in order to disclose the problems he was having, because there was a fear of not being believed or accepted, or it being considered as an excuse for poor behaviour, rather than them being taken seriously. I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level\u20141.5 per cent to 2 per cent\u2014in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much\u2014because we're in discussion about school accountability\u2014might drive some of that at year 10/11. But we don't know why that baseline of 500/600 young people every year is there within our schools. I think that needs further investigation."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. Thanks for that. Can I just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances, and whether you've come across any issues relating to Welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue\u2014that it's not been available, Welsh-medium support, for those learners? Have you come across that at all?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "We haven't necessarily come across it, but we haven't been looking for it either. The Estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from Welsh-medium education to EOTAS. There are a number of potential reasons for that. That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et cetera, are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals, and in many parts of Wales the socio-economic profile of a Welsh-medium education school is slightly different. We are not aware of any particular work that's been done to examine the needs and the provision of Welsh-medium EOTAS. Therefore, my suspicion, without any particular evidence, would be that it happens on a local authority basis, possibly on an incidental basis, depending on the quality and the ability of staff, and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west Wales."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Okay. We can come back to that again, I'm sure. Do you know whether there's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing EOTAS, again in terms of mental health conditions, if there's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision? Have you got any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, of the impact on that?"}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "Not specifically researched on that situation. I think, again, there is so much that we don't actually know and that we should know a lot more about, but I think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else, and they're connected with the issues anyway. So, if you understand that there's a strong link between inequality and exclusion, and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well, that's a really important issue to understand. So, being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities, and I can't emphasis that enough. This is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage. So, being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable. It makes you vulnerable, and I guess the longer that continues I would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be. So, there's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one. Since the publication of our report, we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime. So, we've talked to the youth justice board, we've met with the police, there's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs, and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities, which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society. So, I think we need to understand there's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people, and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held. I would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people, which came out very recently from Public Health Wales and Swansea University, and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years. One thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment, had slipped through all sorts of systems, and were extremely vulnerable. So, I think that's a really big message: that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps\u2014where they're not held within their society\u2014to lengthen and become really, really difficult. So, I think that's my major message on that particular one."}, {"speaker": "Dawn Bowden AM", "content": "Can I just ask, as a follow on from that, whether you've got any views on the potential impact of individual tuition on learners' well-being? So, home tuition, for instance: are pupils going to be on their own doing that? That might be in their best interest, or do you have any concerns that it might not be?"}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "I suppose we don't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils, but what we do know and something that is of huge concern, I suppose, to most people is that there's no central data on how many young people are home schooled. So, it's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally. Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment, if that's what people think is best for them. So, I think that is a concern: not having that transparency of data. And just to reiterate Sarah's point, I suppose, home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things, so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education, but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion, like loneliness and isolation. That child still isn't with its own peer group. That is something that came out of the men's research, as Sarah mentioned. These men, who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide, weren't always interacting with children their own age, and that did cause problems in later life. So, I think it's definitely something we don't know enough about, but I think we need to know more about."}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "There are two questions within there, regarding the delay in entering provision and the effect of long term individual teaching. I think there are occasions on which individual tuition will be beneficial, because there may be a reason why somebody is uncomfortable and unable to operate within an educational setting. However, it may be that, on a longer term basis, that is not entirely appropriate. But it's very much an individual matter. What concerns me, I think, is the idea of there being a gap between mainstream education and entering any form of EOTAS provision due to capacity or otherwise, because that is a period in time\u2014. We don't know whether there's the causation of or exacerbation of mental health issues amongst those in EOTAS, but it's clear that\u2014well, it seems intuitive that a gap between being in mainstream education and EOTAS is unhelpful, not least their rights to an education, but also the feelings that young people who are probably in quite a confused and troubled state may have during that gap and how long that gap can endure. I will refer back: there was a recommendation by Estyn in their 2016 report on EOTAS regarding CAMHS support for children within those settings, I don't know whether there's been any particular progress within that\u2014and especially the mixture of issues that may be related to both mental health and also neurodevelopmental issues and whether those are more or less likely amongst this vulnerable part of the population."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "Just to draw your attention to it, I think there's an acknowledgment that there's a lot we don't know about this. Again, in the loneliness and isolation strategy, there's a commitment to analyse existing education and health data to explore correlations between exclusions or being educated other than at school and mental well-being, including loneliness and isolation. So, I think that's a very welcome commitment to try to expand our understanding in this area, because there may be some pluses as well as minuses, but actually there is so much that we don't know about this."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Thank you. We've got some questions now from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. I think some of them have been covered, but\u2014"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Just in general, once a young person or a child has been excluded, is there enough support for them, not just on the educational side, but in general? Are we supporting these young people, these most vulnerable young people, once they're in the position of having been excluded?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I'd say that that's something that's possibly happening locally, but we don't have a national picture. One of the things we have already noted is the time between being excluded and entering some kind of EOTAS provision. So, that in itself\u2014and I've heard people talking about the capacity issues\u2014shows what's happening to these children, at a time when they are most vulnerable because they are outside of the system."}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "And who should be supporting them? Are we being clear enough with regard to who should be giving them the support? They've been excluded, so obviously the education system has a responsibility, but are we clear enough in terms of who else's responsibility this is, and who should be co-ordinating that support?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "The truth is, the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context, I would say. The point is that, often, these children deal with several other institutions. So, it's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation. More information is needed about this. When I was talking earlier about inclusive education, or some kind of investigation into this, that's the kind of thing I'd look at: how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available. I'm concerned, of course, in terms of education, whether there is enough funding available to ensure this. But because this is a very vulnerable group, we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way, perhaps, as corporate parenting plays a role there. We need to look at that kind of system, and how we help these individuals. I know there are figures available on local authorities, but I can't remember them off the top of my head, but maybe that's something to look at."}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "And as Ian just said, although there's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority, I suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well. But for the parents to support their child, either if they're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in EOTAS, and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible, the parent has to have the right amount of information. They must know where to go for support themselves, and I think that a parent can't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they're not provided with all of the information. And I'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority, but that's something worth thinking about as well."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay. Any other questions?"}, {"speaker": "Sian Gwenllian AM", "content": "Well, unless you want to sum up\u2014?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "Just a comment, really, on the new curriculum and ensuring that EOTAS provision includes this, and how the whole-school approach will work within EOTAS, and how we ensure that the provision is available through the medium of Welsh, as we were referring to earlier, on a national level. Is it possible that it can be worked out within the local consortia, for example? How do we ensure that the teachers\u2014? If it's initial teacher training, or if they're newly qualified teachers, or if they're more experienced, how will this be implemented through the system? Because I think that children in EOTAS situations are usually more vulnerable than others, and therefore there is a need to prioritise their well-being and their mental health. We talk a lot about certificates and so forth, and qualifications, but ensuring everybody's well-being is important, and an important outcome of the work. So, we're thinking of this whole-school approach and how it works within the new curriculum, and this is a vital point for the years to come."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Just before we finish, then, is there anything you wanted to add in terms of what the committee could recommend about professional development for staff that would enhance this provision in this area?"}, {"speaker": "Liz Williams", "content": "Yes, absolutely. I think it's so important for teachers to be equipped with the training and to understand the link between inequality and all the things that come under that term, and challenging behaviour, and I think if teachers are aware of that, and trained properly to deal with that, the risk of exclusion will ultimately lessen. And I think with regard to how that can happen, I think, in some cases, mental health training and mental health awareness training is supplementary at times, with just teacher's training, but I think it should be embedded in the initial teacher's training, so that, more than anything, as well as being equipped with the skills, teachers have the confidence to deal with those really challenging situations."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay, thank you. Ian?"}, {"speaker": "Dr Ian Johnson", "content": "I think that's the importance of a whole-school approach, and that being statutory, because that will ensure that everybody within the school community has that knowledge and awareness and knows what to do and where to signpost people. It means foregrounding and having that in the heart of the school ethos, and I think that turning the school into somewhere that considers mental health and emotional well-being first, rather than waiting for a problem\u2014I think that's the key to improving the well-being of our future generations."}, {"speaker": "Sarah Stone", "content": "I just think it would be great if the community would recognise the link between inequality, adverse childhood experiences, and the opportunity that there is in avoiding a young person falling out of school, and out of anything, and out of sight. So, I think, the other side of this is that this is a real moment of opportunity to intervene positively."}, {"speaker": "Lynne Neagle AM", "content": "Okay.

Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Let's see . Our agenda .

Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that .

Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay well um .

This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table .

Okay . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah um like on a normal remote ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I think everyone's under three anyway ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So I think it's {disfmarker} yeah those are the only two points ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Cool .

Functional requirements ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh no , trend watching . {vocalsound} The other one . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "This one ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and {disfmarker} I mean {vocalsound} i i it sounds good technically"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but it's it's not what they want and uh {disfmarker} So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Now i if we look at fashion in general um {disfmarker} Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ah yes ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .

So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players .

And then changeable fonts , so {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's the most important part , I think . But {disfmarker} And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , maybe the teletext tel"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No , I don't uh {disfmarker} I don't like it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . {vocalsound} And I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it {disfmarker} That's on on the display ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So the focus is on these two parts ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you don't see all the buttons you else need ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh well um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you can't use your thumb for it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "This is how it is now . Um {disfmarker} Here uh {disfmarker} Well we have volume ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it is on uh on the bottom too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "down there . But it's not not the best best ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , why not ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Scroll ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "By just putting the volume on the side ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And the channels as well ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And and just channel buttons here ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But I think uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , or uh maybe uh {disfmarker} The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well . Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's better ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "They're on top ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You mean uh these to the low ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Oh okay . Well , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm {disfmarker} Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to {gap} . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh {vocalsound} you don't see 'em very good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "That's that's good , but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh we we can switch those two ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Those two , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "To use {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that's something we have to decide on ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we have to keep it simple ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved {gap} square ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Square . Like ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "looking , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So the colours also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Black yellow control . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , it's cool . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And still trans"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Still still transparent ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . But with all with logo on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Then the components . The case has just a {disfmarker} Here's black ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{gap} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well one of the options ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "S"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You can {disfmarker} Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you can just replace them I think . That was the idea ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we could do that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "or just uh release one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . {vocalsound} Five different {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Or just uh sell different ones ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Cool ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So you can still th look through it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons .

The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the {vocalsound} uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't {disfmarker} Is {vocalsound} uh a button uh um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How do you say it ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , it's it's all on one level ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It it didn't it i it don't come out of the {vocalsound} on the background ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , on one level ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It is in uh the c a remote control uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I know what you mean .

No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Nah , but they just said we need it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , a recharger maybe ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , we have to make sure to uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Is that still the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an {disfmarker} How do you call it ?

Not a separate {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , just rechargeable batteries ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Then uh I received some possibilities .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So if you hold it , it gets powered ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "If you hold it .

Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm . So"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we can't use the flat buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "we need uh two D_ ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Definitely ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think . Um these kinda materials can be used ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I think so too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "The scroll wheels , that's cool .

Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And um {disfmarker} Yeah , that was it I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh just sk"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We haven't decided yet ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh I don't think a rubber case looks {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "L"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh but we have to do something about the trend ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , i it it should be soft .

It's mentioned here uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But maybe the form has to be a bit different .

Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So {disfmarker} We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these .

I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it's exactly th"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Every remote control's uh different ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , uh I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So it's uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think it's s so simple"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "you just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So but that's for that's for you ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'cause it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so hmm .

Um"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , tha that will be {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?

But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But i it is it is it is already fancy .

Then Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie questioned the reason why the government supported the profiteers for tax evasion when implementing the large employer emergency financing facility. However, Right Hon. Justin Trudeau thought they were making plans to help workers to survive this pandemic and was always their priority to overcome. Hon. Candice Bergen required that how they were dealing with unopened mail at Service Canada and put out a violence case that why the Liberals were making this gun illegal and What the purpose of banning this particular farm rifle was.

Bill Blair support banning Iver Johnson?", "answer": "First, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles, except for law enforcement and military purposes.

She paid taxes on her spousal income, but she was not eligible for CERB. That meant a complicated program delivered by the government that left many people behind, and more importantly, there was no action reacting to it.

The government announced a one-time, tax-free payment of $300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $200 for seniors eligible for GIS. This meant there would be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time.

The government was going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada's tourist regions would be ready when the economy reopened.

Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity Hon. Bill Morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. They would continue to support small businesses. It allowed for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent.

The fishery enterprises were uniquely structured, which was why they were looking at measures to address the concerns they had.

The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the Bill C-69, which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels.

The petitioners have asked us to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which is scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon. They ask that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded, as these will restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses, but in particular, a medicine called Trikafta, which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90% of cystic fibrosis sufferers.

Nearly five million Canadians lack a regular family doctor. This problem is particularly profound in more rural areas, including, as the petitioners reference, the community in which I live, Sydney, British Columbia.

I'm presenting a timely petition today that emphasizes the concerns constituents in my riding of MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon have with the Liberal government's inherently flawed and undemocratic approach to firearms legislation and regulation. The petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed RCMP-vetted Canadians; to focus taxpayer dollars where they will actually increase public safety, which is on keeping at-risk youth from being involved in gangs and on anti-gang enforcement; and to provide our men and women in uniform at the Canada Border Services Agency with the resources they need to stop the flow of illegal guns into this country. Through this petition, my constituents take issue with how the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal weapons smugglers responsible for the violence in our communities. They note that the use of the phrase military-style assault rifle is purely political posturing, as the term is undefined in Canadian law.

It's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512, which was signed by 1,198 petitioners, primarily from the province of Nova Scotia. The Province of Nova Scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations. The petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation, as seen in similar aquaculture operations in British Columbia, Newfoundland, Norway, Vietnam and elsewhere in the world. It also, they cite, would pose risks to native fish stocks, pollute coastal ecosystems, impair at-risk wild Atlantic salmon, and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations. They also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries. They are calling on the government to uphold Bill C-68 and species-at-risk legislation, protect our oceans, ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans, work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and, lastly, invest in land-based, closed-containment finfish aquaculture.

That's what we'll continue to focus on."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie", "content": "Mr.Chair, the question doesn't concern consumers, but merchants. A credit card company, such as Visa and Mastercard, that charges a fee of 2.5%to3% per transaction undermines the merchant's profit margin and gets richer at the expense of consumers.

Instead of providing a universal direct payment for all, the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind. A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19. She pays taxes on her spousal income, but she is not eligible for CERB. The Minister of Employment said that she is looking into this gap. It has been weeks, and still no action. Will the Prime Minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I'm happy, Mr. Chair, to correct the honourable member by pointing out that we actually moved in the most rapid and simplest possible way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit. However, as the member points out, when one moves quickly and efficiently, there will be gaps, and that's why we've been working diligently to try to fill those gaps. We want to make sure that Canadians who need help, get it."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "While the Minister of Employment has been aware of this for three weeks and says she is looking into it, there's still been no action. The truth of the matter is that single parents and their children who depend on spousal support and child maintenance are not getting support. Will the Prime Minister fix this gap?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "We recognize the particular challenge faced by families, single parents and families with young children, which is why we increased the amount of the Canada child benefit to be able to support people in this particular moment. On top of that, we have looked to fill further gaps that have existed with the Canada emergency response benefit. Well over seven million Canadians have access to CERB, and we will continue to work with them"}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "That does not replace spousal support and child maintenance, Prime Minister. Across the country there is no national standard to address the homelessness crisis amidst this pandemic, leaving communities at heightened risk from COVID-19. Canadians who are homeless or living in substandard housing have no access to bathroom facilities for basic hygiene. Those living in crowded SROs and shelters cannot practise social distancing. The problem is particularly acute in my riding in the Downtown Eastside. While the B.C. government has implemented an initiative to house some of the homeless population in empty hotels in the short term, support from the federal government is needed to secure permanent solutions post-COVID-19. Will the Prime Minister commit to providing matching funds and take the right to adequate housing seriously?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "I know that the honourable member wouldn't want to inadvertently mislead the House. The fact is, the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources, hundreds of millions of dollars, to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities, including renting new spaces, to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of COVID-19. I recognize there's always more to do, but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy, we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians, and we will continue to do that."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Jenny Kwan", "content": "The Prime Minister must know that the money the federal government sent is deficient. Many people still remain homeless, and they are at risk. Cutting chronic homelessness by 50% over the next decade is not good enough, and that is this Prime Minister's national housing strategy.

Will he top up the support for provinces to at least match their funds?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, cutting chronic homelessness by 50% is an ambitious goal that no one else has ever been able to do as a government, and we are well on track for it.

They're overrepresented among the homeless population. Why?"}, {"speaker": "Right Hon. Justin Trudeau", "content": "Mr. Chair, we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people. We have moved forward, both through the Minister of Indigenous Services and the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations.

Candice Bergen", "content": "Mr. Chair, we've seen this before, where the Liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes. This is a repeat of what the Liberals have done before. Is the minister saying that the Iver Johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "Actually, what I'm saying, and what our regulations say very clearly, is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in Canadian society.

Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue)", "content": "Mr.Chair, our government considers these to be very difficult times for Canadians.

Diane Lebouthillier", "content": "As I mentioned, we believe that Canadians are going through a very difficult time, and we need to support them.

None of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters, even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency. So let me repeat my question; I don't think there can be a simpler one. The answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the Canada emergency wage subsidy. If an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the CERB, must he reimburse $500for each week he works during the month, or the entire $2,000?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

Carla Qualtrough", "content": "Mr. Chair, that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker.

The elected chiefs have issued a press release asking for the government to halt the joint announcement scheduled for May 14 on the MOU until the community has had a chance to look at and understand how the MOU will affect them.

The federal government should be bringing the community together rather than actively excluding Wet'suwet'en members. The chiefs are so concerned that they are now calling for the resignation of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations for failure to engage in proper consultations, which has stoked divisions within the community. Will the minister reconsider and put in place a consultation process that honours both their traditional house system and the governance responsibilities of elected chiefs and councils?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Carolyn Bennett", "content": "Yet again, it's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the Wet'suwet'en nation.

Will the minister delay the signing?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Carolyn Bennett", "content": "I think the member will agree that there's a lot more work to do with all the parties. I believe, in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before COVID-19, that the work is under way and it will have to be Wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Jamie Schmale", "content": "Mr. Chair, for two weeks now the Liberals on the indigenous affairs committee have shut down Conservatives and witnesses every time we mention the word Wet'suwet'en.

I don't believe that there's, at any time, an interest in shutting down discussion or debate.

We are working on direct supports. We have put in place measures to address processors' concerns so that harvesters continue to have a place to sell their product. We know that more has to be done.

Despite all the upheaval it causes, the crisis we are experiencing, considerable in scope though it is, can also be an opportunity to begin a transition. What is essential in normal times may, during a crisis, become crucial. What is unjust may, in times of crisis, become frankly scandalous. In Quebec, we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality. Yesterday, Ottawa announced new support for large companies. Many of us in Quebec feel that, when a company knocks on the state's door to ask for assistance, it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support. We in the Bloc Qubcois feel that there should be a limit, a ceiling, on the assistance provided to large companies, in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation. That is also the prevalent position in Quebec. A few years ago, after the Bombardier affair in QuebecI will not dwell on that because Quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the National Assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind. A number of civil society groups in Quebec share it also. The United States, which, you will agree, is no bastion of socialism, has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis. The idea is to offer support, but with conditions. According to a report published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives on January2, the 100highest-paid CEOs in Canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker. The average salary for workers increased by 2.6% between 2017 and 2018. Given that inflation was then at 2.3%, it can be said that there was practically no increase. By contrast, the salary increase for CEOs in the same period was 18%, even in cases where the companies suffered losses. Let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted. We cannot even imagine what the figures are today. At this point, we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss. Wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid, but clearly does not flow down to the base. Does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis? The question is clear and I am asking you to give me a clear answer. If I don't get one, I am going to have to demand a new version of the Clarity Act."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable Minister has the floor.

We know that our approach has to help small and medium-size companies, but also large companies in order to provide a bridge to the end of the crisis. In our opinion, that is very important. It will protect the jobs of Canadians and the future of our economy. That's why the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility is very important. That said, we know that it is necessary and important to impose conditions. Yes, we do want to make sure that the facility is available for companies that are going to continue to support our economy, to protect their employees, and to make a significant contribution to our communities. That is why we have attached a number of major conditions to our approach. We will have more details on the subject in the coming days. We established from the outset that we had to impose conditions on executive compensation. That is very important. We are going to consider the rules and conditions that are needed in order for the facility to be available to the companies, the operations and the employees. Of course, conditions are required to ensure that the facility is available for operations, not for dividends or share buybacks, for example. We will impose conditions of that kind. We also want to make sure that we are aware of the situation the companies are in.

During this time, their costs have gone up. They have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery, as many cannot leave their homes. I have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees. These costs all add up, and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic.

This means there will be up to $500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time. Beyond this, we announced $20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that will help seniorsfor example, to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected.

I would also quickly like to thank my staff both here locally in KingsHants and in Ottawa for their continued work for my constituents. Mr. Chair, my question through you is to the minister of agriculture. In KingsHants, agriculture is an important economic driver for our economy. We have the greatest concentration of agriculture producers east of Montreal. From our beef industry to our wine industry and everything in-between, it is extremely important. We have the Kentville Research and Development Centre and the Hants County agricultural exhibition, the longest-standing exhibition in North America. We know that COVID-19 has had impacts on the agriculture industry to differing degrees. In particular, KingsHants is home to an important dairy sector.

Concerning the dairy sector in particular, I'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $300 million to $500 million.

Over the past number of years, we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down. The federal Liberal government's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill, Bill C-69, which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada; and the oil shipping ban, Bill C-48, for the northern coast of British Columbia, which also had a negative effect on the oil industry. These two bills alone pushed over $200 billion of investment out of Canada, causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels. To compound Alberta's economic problems, we have an international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a huge drop in demand for oil.

However, people who think about this issue and the question of the power structure and profit motive, particularly Dr. Matthew Herder of the Health Law Institute at Dalhousie University, are questioning this model.

I wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs. Is that a conversation the minister is having with others?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Navdeep Bains", "content": "I'd like to thank the member for her question. I'm working very closely with Minister Hajdu and the chief science advisor to look at all options. I'm glad the member highlighted the Ebola virus vaccine, which was developed here in Canada. I'm proud of the fact that the DNA sequencing for SARS was also done in Canada. We have incredible scientists and researchers. We are engaging with them and empowering them, and we will continue to share details of this with the public."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May", "content": "Changing gears, we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial. It's very clear to me as an opposition member why we haven't seen legislation on any fast track. It's obviously not the sort of legislation that would gain unanimous consent. Wouldn't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Blair", "content": "I want to thank the member for the question. I want to assure her that at the first opportunity, we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in Canada, including legislation to deal with a buyback program, which we've indicated we will put in place. There are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation. We understand that it's a priority. The pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep Canadians safe, and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Elizabeth May", "content": "I confess that I was disappointed by this morning's announcement on support for seniors. I had been hoping for much more, because I hear from many seniors. I'm going to focus my question for the minister on the issue of seniors homes. Some that are being run by not-for-profit societies are actually running very well, certainly in my community, but they are facing increased costs that could bankrupt them. As yet, there's no program to help a well-run seniors home that is not experiencing a loss of revenue and has lots of staff working hard. These homes have increased costs for wages and increased costs for PPE and nowhere to look for help. Is there help coming?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "I offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe. The member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes, but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things, including costs. We continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through, for example, generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate. We continue to have conversations at the health ministers' table on how we can support them."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "I'm afraid we're out of time on that one. The next question will go to Mr. Davies."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP)", "content": "Mr. Chair, Canadians are appalled by the disgraceful treatment of seniors in care homes across this country. Old folks are being left in soiled clothing and are going without baths for weeks. They are packed four to a room in dangerously unhealthy conditions. The situation is so bad that the armed forces had to be called in to intervene. To the Minister of Health, is her government prepared to take strong action to address this crisis in seniors health care?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, the member has illustrated some of the horror stories that have appalled us all as Canadians and certainly as parliamentarians. We know that seniors deserve to live in dignity and safety with the utmost care, and that just hasn't been happening in this time of COVID and certainly, in some cases, in previous times as well. As the member knows, I've said publicly that I believe we need to hold long-term care homes to stronger standards. I have begun those preliminary conversations with my counterparts. I am working with many ministers across our government to think about how we do that, how we"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "We'll go back to Mr. Davies."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies", "content": "Mr. Chair, if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country, social services would seize them. Over 80% of the deaths in Canada from COVID-19 have occurred in long-term care homes. Canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries, including France, Germany, Denmark and Ireland. Canadians want action. What specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and, in fact, municipal governments, which often run them and fund them partially as well. That's why it's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners, but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country, including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times, to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life, safety and dignity in their elder years."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies", "content": "Mr. Chair, Canadians don't want politicians pointing fingers at each other; they want our seniors taken care of. COVID-19 didn't cause the problems; it exposed them. Decades of neglect by governments at all levels have resulted in this calamity. Not a single province or territory in Canada is meeting the minimum standards of hands-on care for seniors, and death rates from COVID-19 in private, for-profit facilities are two to three times that of public or non-profit homes. Will the minister agree with New Democrats that we need strong national standards, federal funding tied to enforcement and public delivery of care to effectively improve care for seniors?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, certainly the member of Parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing. I don't think that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, what I hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how, first of all, we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Don Davies", "content": "Mr. Chair, what I'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take, but let me move to another subject. Like long-term care, COVID-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system. Millions of Canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs, revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status. Will this government finally move to ensure all Canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Patty Hajdu", "content": "Mr. Chair, as you know, in the mandate that the Prime Minister gave to me, working on a national pharmacare plan is still there. I know it feels like a lifetime ago, but the member has very aptly illustrated why affordable medication is so important as part of a robust health care system. I look forward to continuing our work on ensuring that all Canadians can afford the medication they need."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "It is now over to Mr.Simard."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Mario Simard (Jonquire, BQ)", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. A few weeks ago, the Prime Minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy. MinisterGuilbeault, MinisterMcKenna and MinisterWilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that. Today, I worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell, a convenient post-crisis political pitch. On the natural resources front, the government's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels. We need only think of the $1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells. Perhaps there is an environmental component, but I'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday's announcement by Export and Development Canada. It's going to lend TC Energy $500million to build its Coastal GasLink pipeline. That's $500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually. How does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy?"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The honourable minister has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson (North Vancouver, Lib.)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much for the question. Certainly at this time, Canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent. We are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in Canada. That is the primary focus of the government, as it is of Canadians. Certainly as we move forward, we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future. In that context, we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience, and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon, including the challenge of climate change. Those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis, but at the current time, the focus is clearly on combatting the virus."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Ms.Pauz has a point of order."}, {"speaker": "Ms. Monique Pauz (Repentigny, BQ)", "content": "There was absolutely no interpretation while the minister was speaking."}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Since so many are having issues with the interpretation, let's take a quick break while I try to fix the problem on my end. I'm going to ask the minister to repeat his answer, and we'll see whether the interpretation comes through this time. If not, please let me know, Ms.Pauz and anyone else who doesn't hear it."}, {"speaker": "Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson", "content": "Of course, the issues of the future are very important. That means not just climate change, but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis, challenges we need to take into account. Now, I think Canadians want us to take the time to focus on what is currently going on. We have put rules in place to protect Canadians. We really need to think about this. We need a plan. Of course, we need to think about the future, but I want Canadians"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "Mr.Simard has the floor."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Mario Simard", "content": "Thank you, Mr.Chair. I want to tell you that, of all industries, the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry. Unfortunately, in Canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries, including providing liquidity support. Yesterday's announcement suggests that the $500million being provided by EDC is for a single project: Coastal GasLink. In 2017, under the softwood lumber action plan, EDC's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $500million. Now, EDC is shelling out $500million for just one project, Coastal GasLink, even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $500million when it needed EDC's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs. The industry accounts for 58,000jobs in Quebec and $6billion of Quebec's GDP. As I see it, there is a fundamental inequity. My question is for the natural resources minister. Does he think this situation is fair? Will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Seamus O'Regan", "content": "Mr.Chair, since 2017, our government has invested billions of dollars.  I'll answer the question in English.  Sorry. We launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities. We introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry. Building on our work today, we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates, diversifies and grows. Over these past two and a half months, I have spent an inordinate amount of time with CEOs, with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast. A few days ago, I convened a meeting of CEOs from all parts of this country, from Quebec to British Columbia, to talk to them about solutions, about answers. The liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them. We will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the COVID crisis, so we make sure that"}, {"speaker": "The Chair", "content": "The next question will go to Mr. Dalton."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marc Dalton (Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, CPC)", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm hearing from small business owners like Joel, who runs a fitness club here in Pitt MeadowsMaple Ridge, and is very concerned that their landlords refuse to participate in the rent assistance program. These businesses have seen revenue drops between 50% and 100% and are asking for just 25% off their rent. When will the government help small businesses whose landlords refuse to be team players during this pandemic?"}, {"speaker": "Hon. Bill Morneau", "content": "Mr. Chair, first of all, we share the member's concern that small businesses be supported. That's why we've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance. With respect to rent support, we are encouraging landlords to support this measure. Obviously, rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction. At every opportunity I talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there. We will continue to support small businesses. We believe this program has significant merit. It allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75% of the rent. We think it is an excellent program. It will require the provinces to step forward and enforce it."}, {"speaker": "Mr. Marc Dalton", "content": "Mr. Chair, here in B.C., businesses are preparing for phased reopening.

I have constituents who are working part time and casually. They're worried that if they take an extra shift, they will lose their CERB, but if they refuse a shift, they will also lose their CERB. It's a classic Liberal catch-22. A worker may unknowingly make over the $1,000 by a couple of dollars. Does the government intend to make them repay all their CERB if they barely go over the threshold?"}, {"speaker": "Hon.

The model would be made of lightweight plastic with a smooth bottom and a nice scallop shell exterior.", "relevant_text_span": [["414", "478"]]}], "meeting_transcripts": [{"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Help . {gap} It's up there ?

What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm .

You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah the the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "They are ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh I see ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and how much you need to send the data across ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .

And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm .

Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh any comments like , if you want ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay .

Look at that ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but I think I'll just keep it simple ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{gap} That's fine ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "and that would help keep them from getting lost .

Industrial Designer, Marketing and User Interface gave presentations mainly on component design, current trend and interface design respectively, based on their research on the website incorporating the ideas from last meeting. A lot of discussions was centred around the fruit and vegetable theme, which was the current marketing trend. In the meanwhile, they had some discussions on physical attributes and the use of energy. They agreed that the screen was not necessary, and TV could be used as the screen instead. In addition, Kryptonite became their preferred energy."}], "specific_query_list": [{"query": "What did the group discuss about the current trend and potential materials?", "answer": "Marketing proposed that the fancy look and feel were more important than the functionality of the product. The fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend, and marketing himself preferred fruits to vegetables. Therefore, how spongy the material could be should be taken into consideration when choosing the materials. The potential materials to accomplish the fruit and vegetable theme could be a sort of rubber, which was used in the stress balls. The alternative option was to use a cover for it, and choose a colour that fits one's sitting room.", "relevant_text_span": [["30", "63"], ["267", "329"]]}, {"query": "What did the Industrial Designer say about component design?", "answer": "Industrial Designer thought some parts needed custom design, and other parts should just use standard. For example, the case needed custom design to protect the remote and the locator, and the circuit board needed custom design as well, while the buttons and the wheels, radio sender and receiver were all standard parts. In addition, beeper or other noise things were needed as well for locating the remote. Rubber, plastic, wood and titanium were options of materials, but better not titanium.

Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .

Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um {vocalsound} how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um {disfmarker} Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes , I think it should be something like that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "right ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "not {disfmarker} we're we're {disfmarker} it's not a {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh {disfmarker} don't have the information for it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No . No ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} Well , the techni fu technical function uh {gap} {disfmarker} what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that was my {disfmarker} really my part for uh this session . Um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well , that's just the fu the technical function is {vocalsound} pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It just should change the T_V_'s state ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that's it . Um but furthermore {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , with buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Or are there any o other controls ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Are there only {disfmarker} any other cont Well , {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh-huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "They're very vu vulnerable ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "w yes ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "so you must {vocalsound} point everywhere , so maybe infrared is {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe not even pointed . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh is that uh {disfmarker} are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or {disfmarker} yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in {disfmarker} outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Two more things ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , s yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um {vocalsound} in dark too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So when it's dark {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Those are two really uh user interface {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . {gap} {disfmarker} That's perfect . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Do do you {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the {disfmarker} such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So {disfmarker} we'll probably have to implement that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "but I've seem to forget them {disfmarker} {vocalsound} forgot them . Um {disfmarker} oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Well , maybe I um {disfmarker} but it it can be quite simple ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "The uh the the digits in black ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{disfmarker} well , it can be for design , of course ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes , but there's a cost limitation too ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , that's more {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "twelve Euro fifty , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The cost price is very low ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Just remind something ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You have a m uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . Very good point . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But um {disfmarker} Necessary , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah . I dunno , it's uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that's more Sebastian's uh um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Cause I think Bluetooth uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} It's use uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well does it ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I know it from the cell phone ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "well {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I'm not sure . Uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's {disfmarker} it seems to work uh quite okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So uh technically it will be possible ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Does it {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , you cannot ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} It's over ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "See you in thirty minutes ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Great ."}]}
