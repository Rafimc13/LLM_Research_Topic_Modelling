Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show .

Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "I don't know if it's expensive maybe to {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I don't {disfmarker} yeah I mean it {disfmarker} but like I mean {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Maybe call is enough . But yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "just I mean like your phone even just has so {disfmarker} like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could {disfmarker} I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a {disfmarker} yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "like just to have a home for it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah yeah yeah yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I mean {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Well that's why it's always in the couch ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , in in the couch {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah so we {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the project is now couches and remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Something like that ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And the other thing is {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Bigger ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Not {disfmarker} well it needs to be sort of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Like Hand hand held size , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Hand-sized ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . I don't think you need a {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Not not huge , but {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But definitely not {disfmarker} well I don't know ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No , it can't be , uh-uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No it really wouldn't be ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Huh ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Like spaceship ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": ". Yeah {vocalsound} .

Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . So what do we think this remote control should {disfmarker} Five minutes ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh dear ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Till the meeting {disfmarker} oh right . This is what we have left . Um , oh we just {gap}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , I agree ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , yeah yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You {disfmarker} what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "That would be cool ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . I mean it just seems like {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you could like um {disfmarker} like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can {disfmarker} the way you do it on your radio is that you uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "what do you call it {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Select . Uh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's something we could decide . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Because {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Because , I don't know if it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I think it's e expensive , if you have {disfmarker} if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "and then use the telly as a screen ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I'm thinking kind of {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But yeah for sure . Something like not {disfmarker} it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "is that what you mean ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Or like you h you see those you know people {disfmarker} I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those {disfmarker} these things that at their house you know {disfmarker} their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that {disfmarker} and it's like a hand held like {disfmarker} turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like {disfmarker} so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if {disfmarker} it must be {disfmarker} it would probably {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah .

Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "What was the word ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Furry ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Water resistant ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh I was just {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No but it's {disfmarker} I thought , ah , spot on ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Mm , mm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "That's quite annoying ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "like that's another {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , clip . Ooh {vocalsound} . Um ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "yeah {vocalsound} um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing .

Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um {vocalsound} the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional {disfmarker} uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's okay {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "sorry Project Manager {vocalsound} . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . {vocalsound} Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year .

It's it's still the same . Um {disfmarker} All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well .

Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too .

Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the {vocalsound} uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot .

Well uh the components ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't {disfmarker} I w I was a little short on time .

Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can {disfmarker} Basically if the battery is low , it won't work ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , and {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push .

You have your finger over the button . So you can see {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It must be around it then ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because I was short on time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No worry ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But um {disfmarker} Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , I just want to talk some {disfmarker} about some more .

Okay . {vocalsound} No , it's not {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So , but uh {disfmarker} Yeah . What other features can we put in ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular .

It lights up all ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's right . You have to {disfmarker} Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And do we use a a {disfmarker} Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , {gap} if you can look through it .

Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so y you just make it th through {disfmarker} You look through it ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "A see-through . Mm , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . Uh as an option maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's the standard {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , uh {disfmarker} Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "But you have {disfmarker} You had a lot of different buttons ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "we but we don't {disfmarker} We don't really have any complicated buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , maybe you have you have to {disfmarker} Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay , but {disfmarker} Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control .

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah yeah , one level .

Uh yellow ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm .

Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a {disfmarker} it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . {vocalsound} We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension .

Right ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing .

You could place a {disfmarker} um uh this this would be the button ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "There {disfmarker} the icons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "The scroll-wheel , I mean .

So if you uh {disfmarker} You just move the problem ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I mean {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well , I'm I'm not so sure ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Y uh can you separate these uh these {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think it c should be Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber .

What {disfmarker} the first thing {disfmarker} question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that {disfmarker} well it wasn't really my area because {vocalsound} I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um and uh {vocalsound} I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm . Could I {disfmarker} can I interject to ask a question there ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah sure ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the {gap} surrounding it ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah the the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "They are ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh I see ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and how much you need to send the data across ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh {disfmarker} just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .

And then finally , um we want uh the {disfmarker} it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of {disfmarker} d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa {vocalsound} thing that you could have ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm .

Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's {disfmarker} it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering {gap} maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will {gap} this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you {disfmarker} you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like {disfmarker} it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh {disfmarker} added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not {disfmarker} of no use of punching in the uh {disfmarker} trying to put in those things in {disfmarker} on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in {disfmarker} add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's {disfmarker} so this is {disfmarker} if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use {disfmarker} usage and all that ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh any comments like , if you want ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay .

Look at that ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . {vocalsound} Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . {vocalsound} Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there . {vocalsound} Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take {disfmarker} said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh {disfmarker} when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . {vocalsound} I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "but I think I'll just keep it simple ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "if there's any more information I can email you extra details ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{gap} That's fine ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay .

Uh , I think so , just {disfmarker} Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting .

Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Ah yes ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .

In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means .

And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than {disfmarker} you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . {vocalsound} And that's all I have to say about the matter , {vocalsound} um ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'Kay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Shall I {disfmarker} what do I do ?

Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um {vocalsound} does it do {disfmarker} or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but {disfmarker} And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . {vocalsound} Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um {vocalsound} like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . {vocalsound} That concludes my presentation ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{gap}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "How do I um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "S That's on view ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .

So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um {disfmarker} This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players .

Yeah , well it's {disfmarker} Basically it's it's here ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , that's better ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "They're on top ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ .

So the focus gets on these parts and not on there ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So we can uh switch these to {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . Yeah , maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh we we can switch those two ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Those two , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh {disfmarker} Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right . {gap}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we {disfmarker} I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Yeah , that's cool ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "To use {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So that's something we have to decide on ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we have to keep it simple ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . What we're gonna do . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not {disfmarker} Nothing square-like ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so {disfmarker} Hmm , okay . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah well uh iPod is trendy .

Like ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay . So not {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the {vocalsound} remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "looking , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So the colours also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Black yellow control . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but uh {vocalsound} I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , okay . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , it's cool . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah .

So that you just um {disfmarker} It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Like a very big scroll-wheel . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Maybe , I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so we {vocalsound} have this at the moment ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , you {gap} {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "we'd have this .

Only if you use your finger ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh {disfmarker} That's not scrollable too easy ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? Still on the bottom"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think in middle ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh wh what is the middle part ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "That's the numbers ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Numbers , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I agree as well ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Use the dz"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because you already have the volume here , so {disfmarker} You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . {gap} back and forth ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But that's not {gap} want to zap very quick , so {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ? Is this a opportunity ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And then you use those uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "or you don't want a different {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , of course uh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Why ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But still the next {disfmarker} It's still the next one . Doesn't make {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is {disfmarker} {vocalsound} If you put them {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah . I I think it's {disfmarker} It's it's obvious , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , that's not not {disfmarker} It's not al uh always the same ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But it's exactly th"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "In uh {disfmarker} On most on most remote controls ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Every remote control's uh different ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I dunno . I {disfmarker} You already have the volume on the side ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , uh I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So it's uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think it's s so simple"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "you just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So but that's for that's for you ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'cause it's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay , so hmm . What did {disfmarker} What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And the LED ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , you have uh {disfmarker} It is {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You have to look at that image of the iPod ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yes . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "More that uh kind of style ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And a bit uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Not not the old grey black {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Where you can put a ve Uh we have {disfmarker} If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ?

Um"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "I think {disfmarker} Yeah . That's your choice , I think huh ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , tha that will be {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So you could put it like that ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , so top down ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Do we have to design that w as well ?"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh I'm not sure ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The docking station ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think so ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But th Yeah , that can be very simple .

But {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No . Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "More rounded . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one .

If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And you have the scroll button inside . {gap} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yes . Just a simple scrollb"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?

Yeah , it's cool ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it .

But {vocalsound} you're {disfmarker} If you look at the way remote controls are now {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "And if you make it look like the iPod {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , they're all the same ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the {vocalsound} wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "compared to {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Ye yeah . Well uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah , we could do that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Could ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No , I think {disfmarker} Oh ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "It's right ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Think the scroll wheel {vocalsound} won't be very big .

Well ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay .

The team got acquainted with each other and Project Manager described the scope of the project. Industrial Designer claimed that he could support any practical ideas technically and proposed that they could make an interoperable remote control.

My personal preferences were ease of uh {disfmarker} the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh {disfmarker} it can be more trendy in in user design .

Okay . Sebastian ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Excuse me . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Scusi . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um {disfmarker} Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Energies and uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "but it's hardly readable . Can you see it ?"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "No , it's not visible ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No ? Well {disfmarker} Um , there's a energy source here . {vocalsound} And um basically there {disfmarker} it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . {vocalsound} Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . {vocalsound} It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yes . In the {disfmarker} and it's a little more {disfmarker} a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . {vocalsound} So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So it's fairly easy ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} Succeed in it also ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , so uh"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "good ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "{vocalsound} And what's the um {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "I think our uh users will really uh will really like that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we can use them .

So , the channel switching ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Or {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But I think {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Hmm , true . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "and not for {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yes . Well , it's not one light , it {disfmarker} there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No no no , no . That's right , that's right ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So {disfmarker} well , this uh should be it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} Um have a think about it ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah . Okay , Ruud ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Oh , mine is already outdated ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay well ,"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound} Since uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "So any income is welcome . {vocalsound} Input ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay , make {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .

So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "You mean the loo the look , the outside ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The look , how it look like ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , the the look is is bad for them"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so {disfmarker} doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So this is from the experiments we've done ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .

So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Functions ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "this would definitely be a good way of selling more .

And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Sure ? Yeah ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , I think possible . Because we can {disfmarker} We can uh mix uh several function in one button ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So lets you {disfmarker} then you have less buttons ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ?"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But I'm not sure {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The manuals ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ,"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "manual ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I think the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "It's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "No you you can have a switch menu , so you can"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , but it has to be intuitive ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "well for example {disfmarker} Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah , okay . Okay ,"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Then you you put the switch button ,"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "but {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "then it switch to another category of functions .

Yeah , maybe ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Uh {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah , personalised colour .

Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of {vocalsound} our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think {disfmarker} looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um {vocalsound} so actually I think {disfmarker} Yeah um f {vocalsound} you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your {disfmarker} to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You could change the vegetable , or fruit ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "yeah , I can change the vegetable ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh is that broccoli ? {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "This one's broccoli {vocalsound} ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "The {disfmarker} it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "'S a very bright strawberry . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's been a l"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .

How how {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well the locator is just chip that's inside there ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Okay so that's just {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So you have to have a button on your on your {disfmarker} you have to attach the button to the {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Yeah we didn't design that ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah we have {disfmarker} that that has yes yet to be designed ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it would be coordinating with that of course ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . {vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "So . Tada ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs .

Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . {vocalsound} But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ?

Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and {disfmarker} d I dunno what that means ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "One side is curved and then the other side is curved ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Well {disfmarker} yeah . If we're talking about the area just {disfmarker} oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button .

Do you see anything that I've missed ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "No I think that's alright ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound}"}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "And if we sold a lot of squishy things ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "Mm ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Boo yeah .

I think that's {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "So I need {disfmarker} where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't {disfmarker} okay . Um the method is {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is {disfmarker} everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And {vocalsound} we we have therefore in total um {disfmarker} We have five {disfmarker} we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Mm-hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Marketing", "content": "Um so the que the questions I've given you {disfmarker} c could you write that down ?

Very very true . Okay ."}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "{vocalsound} I imagine they're somewhere on the front .

But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Industrial Designer", "content": "Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . Mm ."}, {"speaker": "User Interface", "content": "But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Project Manager", "content": "Yeah .
