For spectral subtraction, the team discussed recreating data with FFT of combining the Weiner filtering with the signal subspace.

And he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , {vocalsound} run things using P - make and Customs . You don't actually have to write P - make scripts and things like that . The simplest thing {disfmarker} And I can send an email around or , maybe I should do an FAQ on the web site about it or something . Um ,"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "How about an email that points to the FAQ ,"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "there 's a c"}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "you know what I 'm saying ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Yeah , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor C", "content": "so that you can {disfmarker} Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called \" run command \" . \" Run dash command \" , \" run hyphen command \" . And , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh {disfmarker} and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . So you can try this as a simple test with uh , the L S command . So you can say \" run dash command L S \" , and , um , it 'll actually export that {vocalsound} LS command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an LS on your current directory . So , substitute LS for whatever command you want to run , and um {disfmarker} And that 's a simple way to get started using {disfmarker} using this . And , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , {vocalsound} um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . Now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the P - make and Customs network has attributes associated with it . Uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like \" run command \" , you can specify those attributes for your program . For example if you only want your thing to run under Linux , you can give it the Linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available Linux machine and run it on that . So . You can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . Each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . So you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . If there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . So , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now Andreas and I have been the main ones using it and we 're {disfmarker} Uh .

Exactly . Yeah , you know , I {disfmarker} I sort of got started {comment} using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh I fired off a training job , and then I fired off a recognition job and I get this email about midnight from Andreas saying , \" uh , are you running two {vocalsound} trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . \" So I had to back off a little bit . But , soon as we get some more machines then uh {disfmarker} then we 'll have more compute available . So , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . So ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Um , I have {disfmarker} I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little {disfmarker} little jobs to do ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Um , how do I do it with \" run command \" ? I mean do {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "You could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "Uh - huh . A thousand times ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "right ? But you probably wanna be careful with that"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "because um , you don't wanna saturate the network .

Um ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad G", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "PhD F", "content": "so you should try to limit it to somet sometim some number around ten jobs at a time . Um .

So the {disfmarker} The idea is that we need to have {disfmarker} We need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want .

And then , it 's a form , HTML form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded .

Yeah , and Um I {disfmarker} that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but um we have to know what we want first .

So um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . Right ? So as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these S have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . So what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? These are all like saying EV or A , right ? So it 's not just a generalized situation like I mean basically we wanna just take a combination of {disfmarker} we wanna view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wanna sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Hmm .

All of their outputs combined to make a decision ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? That 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? So um that 's what we want , we want for example P of um let 's call this guy Y and let 's call these X - one , X - two XN , right . So we want probability that Y equals , you know , for example um E given that these guys are I 'll just refer to this as like X um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? Given that for example the data says you know , A , V , A , E , or something right ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So we would like to do this kind of combination ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Alright , so um Is that uh I {disfmarker} yeah , I just wanna make sure everybody is with us before he goes on ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "I think so , yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "It 's {disfmarker} it 's cl e is {disfmarker} is it clear what he wants to compute ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . So , right . So Basically um {vocalsound} what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of E and V and A and every single letter E , s give a number"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "because that 's obviously not desirable . What we wanna do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So those are the two things that we uh need . So what uh I guess , what Jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? So for example here two people have voted for A , one has voted for V , and one has voted for E , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being E is one over four , because one person voted for E out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of E s and then probability of A given all that is um two out of four and probability of V is one out of four . Right ? So that 's step {disfmarker} that 's the uh yeah that 's the {disfmarker} that 's the basic uh thing . Now"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Um Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Is that all OK ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "And that one outcome , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "What ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "it 's X {disfmarker} X - one voted for A X - two voted for V"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "and so forth ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Y right . Yep ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "S so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's the outcome ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Mm - hmm . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "so that"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . So step two is um right . So we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "X - one matters more i than X - two or"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . Sure , so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth so we could replace this by uh W - one , W - two , W - three , and W - four"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "right ? And in order for this to be a valid probability distribution for each um X - hat , we just need that the W 's sum to one . So they can be for example , you know you {disfmarker} you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say ."}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "That 's one ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "And that 'd be one . So that um also seems to work fine . And uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So I jus just to make sure I understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "You 'd compute the weighted average , so the probability of E would be uh"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK , so {disfmarker} so it 'd be so in this case the probability that Y equals A would be uh {comment} W one times {disfmarker}"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Point three ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "or A or {disfmarker} let 's see , one full quarter times point one"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Not one quarter ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four . So you can view these as gone ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Probability of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah . OK . So , alright . So this is uh step two . So the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . So the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called \" H \" , OK ? This is a hidden variable . And what this is is it gets its input from X - one , X - two , X - three , and X - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . Right ? And then these guys all come here . OK . So this is sightly uh more complicated . So what 's going on is that um this H node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . So H produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? Now this guy he looks at the value of H say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . That 's all there is to say , I guess about it . Right , so you can have a mixture that"}, {"speaker": "Grad E", "content": "Mm - hmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So {disfmarker} so the function of the thing that comes out of H is very different from the function of the other inputs . It 's driving how the other four are interpreted . OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So H passes a vector on to the next node ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "It could ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "It could ? A vector of the weights as the se"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , it could"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "oh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Sorry ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Well a vector with three zero 's and one one , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right , so I mean the way you desc"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "W I was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , couldn't you ? OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Um Does H have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the {disfmarker} that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ OK . Hmm . OK . OK . I mean It {disfmarker} it just seems that like without that {disfmarker} that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if {disfmarker} if uh X - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of X - on or i if X - one says no then ignore X - one , you know , I mean that seems like that 'd be weird ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , well could be things like if X - two and X - three say yes then i ignore X - one also ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "right ? Oh , OK . OK . Alright , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Oh The situations that H has , are they built into the net or OK , so they {disfmarker} they could either be hand coded or learned or OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Based on training data , OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Yes ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "So you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . Oh yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah . Um Well , I mean to learn them we need data , where are we gonna get data ? Well I mean we need data with people intentions , right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Right , right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Which is slightly tricky . Right ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "Uh - huh ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mm - hmm .

OK ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we {disfmarker} I mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - E , or endpoint sub uh {pause} you know s S ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Well , basically you would say , based on {disfmarker} in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Mmm . Mmm ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "right ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "So this is what we wanna learn . Yep . Right . Hmm . Yeah . I don't think , well you have a {disfmarker} can you bring up the function thing ? Um w where is the thing that allows you to sort of"}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "That 's on the added variable , isn't it ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Oh function properties , is that it ? Hmm , I guess not . Yeah , that 's"}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "No ."}, {"speaker": "Grad D", "content": "Right . OK . And um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which I think is unlikely , I think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such CPU 's on your own in the java base format . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah I was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's Right . Yeah ."}, {"speaker": "Grad C", "content": "Ah . Well in terms of java base I think it 's basically what you see is what you get in I don't yeah , I would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here ."}, {"speaker": "Grad A", "content": "So Yeah . Yeah . By the way um uh just talking about uh about that general end of things uh is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting with the system and so on ? Like , I mean , what kind of questions are being given {disfmarker} being asked ? Cuz {disfmarker} OK . Yeah yeah . OK . OK . Fey , you mean . OK . OK . O OK . OK . I 'm just wondering , because in terms of , you know , I mean uh w the figure {disfmarker} I was thinking about this figure that we talked about , fifty constructions or whatever that 's uh that 's a whole lot of constructions and um you know , I mean one might be f fairly pleased with getting a really good analysis of five maybe ten in a summer so , I mean I know we 're going for sort of a rough and ready . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . OK . OK . I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was {disfmarker} uh I was talking about the , you know , if you wanted to do it really in detail and we don't really need all the detail for what we 're doing right now but anyway in terms of just narrowing that task you know which fifty do I do , I wanna see what people are using , so Well , it will inspire me .

Right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist {pause} or {pause} whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . Or {disfmarker} Yes , we could things we couldn't extract the {disfmarker} from the data , the hidden variables . Yes , good .

Well , something using place of articulation which {disfmarker} which leads to {pause} nine , I think , {pause} broad classes . Uh , another which is based on manner , which is {disfmarker} is also something like nine classes . And then , {pause} something that combine both , and we have {pause} twenty f {pause} twenty - five ?"}, {"speaker": "Grad F", "content": "Twenty - seven ."}, {"speaker": "PhD D", "content": "Twenty - seven broad classes .

They {disfmarker} they clearly did actually remove {pause} silent sections in order {disfmarker} because they {pause} got these {pause} word error rate {pause} results .

Whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , I don't know . Um . Uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the {pause} word models are pretty bad and nobody wants {disfmarker} {pause} has {disfmarker} has approached improving them . So {pause} it 's possible that a lot of the problems {pause} with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models {pause} to begin with . So {pause} this might just be a temporary thing . But {disfmarker} But , on the other hand , and maybe {disfmarker} maybe it 's a decent idea . So um The question we 're gonna wanna go {pause} through next week when Hynek shows up I guess is given that we 've been {disfmarker} if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at {pause} uh , by then I guess , combinations of features and multi - band Uh , and we 've been looking at {pause} cross - language , cross {pause} task {pause} issues . And they 've been not so much looking at {pause} the cross task uh multiple language issues . But they 've been looking at uh {disfmarker} {pause} at these issues . At the on - line normalization and the uh {pause} voice activity detection . And I guess when he comes here we 're gonna have to start deciding about {pause} um what do we choose {pause} from what we 've looked at {pause} to um blend with {pause} some group of things in what they 've looked at And once we choose that , {pause} how do we split up the {pause} effort ? Uh , because we still have {disfmarker} even once we choose , {pause} we 've still got {pause} uh another {pause} month or so , I mean there 's holidays in the way , but {disfmarker} but uh {pause} I think the evaluation data comes January thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time {pause} to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites {pause} in that {disfmarker} that amount of time ."}, {"speaker": "PhD A", "content": "When they removed the silence frames , did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer knows it 's {disfmarker} {pause} knows when it 's time to back trace or something ?"}, {"speaker": "Professor B", "content": "Well , see they , I {disfmarker} I think they 're Um . I don't know the {disfmarker} {pause} the specifics of how they 're doing it .

Um , but uh No I mean it sounds like {disfmarker} I mean {pause} there {disfmarker} there {disfmarker} there are the usual number of {disfmarker} of {pause} little {disfmarker} little problems and bugs and so forth but it sounds like they 're getting ironed out .

Anybody remember ?"}, {"speaker": "PhD G", "content": "Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought , that was totally separate from the interface .

So , uh {disfmarker} Yep .
