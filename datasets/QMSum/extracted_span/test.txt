<s> what were the topics talked about in the meeting ? </s> postdoc f : that sounds like a spy code . ba - based on some of the tran uh i in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one i 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , professor e : so . um . let 's see . i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus . grad c : well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . postdoc f : i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b : i would i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . professor e : yeah . actually it this this maybe brings up another topic which is um so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . grad c : yeah , actually i i was going to say we need to talk about that too . professor e : yeah . why why do n't we do that . yeah . but we 've had more problems with that . that seems to be the key issue . yeah . um , that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and um i heard from uw that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c : well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . i do n't know how much of it 's public . professor e : yeah . but anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw . so . um . but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony , grad c : as professionally as i guess you can get it done . professor e : well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's grad c : i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e : that tha that can be quite good . th - this yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . grad c : and , i mean we 'll see , tomorrow , you know , what it looks like . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . professor e : so anyway i think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c : mm - hmm . phd b : um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but i 've noticed in the past that when i 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , { comment } a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis mm - hmm . mm - hmm . oh so you already have that , ok . postdoc f : well that 's that 's a way that 's you know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy i wan na do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which are n't in the lexicon . phd b : mm - hmm . cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , postdoc f : exactly . and then you ca then you can do a s i already had that convention but i i have n't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz i think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . that was what i was always planing on . so that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say `` curly bracket laugh curly bracket `` , phd b : mm - hmm . postdoc f : so man so many ways that error prone . so , um , um i 'm i 'm going to convert that via a filter , into these tagged uh , subcategorized comments , and same thing with you know , we see you get a subset when you do what you 're saying , and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know i mean , jus i do n't know if that 's really necessary to do that . maybe it 's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh , a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there , and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's uh the you know , { comment } uh enumerated , or i and uh , thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and i have n't i have n't been able to use that yet cuz i 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . and um , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . and i have t ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that . and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . so um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up `` gobbledy - gook `` . yes . more of an attempt to i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , then cuz `` neural nets `` and oh she has some things that are oh `` downsampled `` , she got that right . grad c : obscure , yeah . postdoc f : but they have n't gotten to the end of that yet . yeah . they are . mm - hmm . they 're very efficient . there 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . phd a : the basic thing is this hmm base . grad c : so there 's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time . you know what i mean ? across all of them . phd a : so . but basically that 's one of the main changes . i 'm not sure about the term . professor e : um , let 's see . i think the uh were were you basically done with the transcription part ? so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing . grad c : right . so the the idea is that we need to have we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they do n't want . so i 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . and then , it 's a form , html form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . and so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , a single password . each person will have a single password , user name and password . and then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . and that way each person only has to remember one password . professor e : i i ca n't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . i mean if people have uh , i mean , for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it . and then um if i thought it was ok , i 'd say `` it 's ok `` . grad c : and so that that 's a minor part of it , i just wanted some web interface so that people you did n't actually have to send everyone the text . so m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um i would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , `` here 's the web page `` , um , `` you need a password `` . so th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wan na provide this information if they want it . well , i do n't think it 's that much harder than , paper . so . postdoc f : i have one question . so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? because i i do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e : but the way i imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gon na go `` oh yeah , i did n't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? `` and then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? ok there 's i mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . grad c : for the most frequent case they just say `` it 's ok `` and then they 're done . and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . professor e : mm - hmm . phd b : so that means other people are editing what you say ? professor e : uh i do n't know about that . grad c : well , the only other choice is that the person would say `` no , do n't distribute this meeting at all `` , and i would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say `` do n't distribute it at all `` . professor e : right ? yeah . yeah , but that 's our decision then . right ? grad c : um , i do n't think so . i mean , because if i object to the conversation . professor e : i think it is . grad c : if i say `` we were having a conversation , and i consider that conversation private , `` and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , i wan na be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f : the i agree that the consent forms were uh , i cons agree with what adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or did n't say them . professor e : um i mean it 's also a mixture of people , i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . you know ? grad c : well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former . postdoc f : that 's true . professor e : but we 're trying to expand this , right ? postdoc f : good point . professor e : there 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me . um , i think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . grad c : i mean that 's why i did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient . professor e : i think that 's the bad idea . but i and and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . i think some researchers who are gon na be working with this corpus years from now are really gon na be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there { comment } that 's missing from the dialogue . you know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , and they can bleep out stuff they do n't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so `` well i did n't like what he said . `` grad c : well i do n't see any way of avoiding that . i mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they do n't like . so that the professor e : you 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . but i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . y but you do n't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i 'm saying . phd b : only if they want it . grad c : what i 'm saying is that i ca n't just email them the password because that 's not secure . so they have to call me and ask . well , we do because of privacy . we ca n't just make it openly available on the web . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor e : not just for fun , ok ? but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory . um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , ok ? then , if someone uh wants to review it , uh , and i know you do n't like this , but i 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . and then if they say that `` i have a potential problem with these things , `` then , you you say `` ok well you might wan na hear this in context to s think if you need that , `` you issue them a password , i in the grad c : but the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . i would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . obviously they do n't have to . so i think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just do n't think that 's gon na happen . postdoc f : i 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . cuz i think if they feel that uh , it 's i th i th you know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and did n't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they did n't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , but but they might be able to argue `` oh well it was cumbersome , and i was busy and it was gon na take me too much time to trace it down `` . so it could that the burden would come back onto us . so i 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . i mean we could offer that but but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . and and i ha and it does n't { comment } really say we 'll send it to you , or wi it 'll be available for you on the web , or anything . phd b : i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . grad c : they just have to make sure that it is available to them . professor e : yeah , ok , so . wh um i think i have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . so i i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , i mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . that that we really would rather it was n't a patchwork of things tossed out , grad c : well , but they wo n't get that feedback . and then at some point i 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . i mean i do n't wan na have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . postdoc f : al - also it ther there is this other question , the legal question that that adam 's raised , uh about whether we need a concrete signature , or email c i suffices or whatever and i do n't know how that works . i there 's something down there about `` if you agree to `` grad c : i do n't think so . and so i do n't think they need another signature . postdoc f : well i s i also have this i i think it 's nice you have it uh , viewab her { comment } hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um , the non nonverbal side , i mean i i agree that our bias should be as as expressed here , and but i i think it 's nice that a person could check . cuz sometimes you know you the words on a on the page , come out soun sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it . professor e : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . postdoc f : and i realize we should n't emphasize that people { comment } you know , should n't borrow trouble . what it comes down to but grad c : yeah i think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good . you know , if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that . postdoc f : oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that did n't get detected and there was a whole uh i segment a against some personal i th grad c : right . that was all mumbled ? postdoc f : but but it was all the words were all visible , but they did n't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript . yeah that 's true . grad c : mm - hmm . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah that 's right . grad c : so um , in terms of password distribution , i think phone is really the only way to do it , phone and in person . or mail , physical mail . any sub - wor yeah , ok . i mean you could do it with pgp or things like that but it 's too complex . postdoc f : i mean . so it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , to have that be the professor e : well yeah , but you ca n't dep i mean , most people will not wan na take the time to do that , though . postdoc f : yeah , ok , fair enough . and they 're s they 're absorbing the responsibility themselves . professor e : but i mean if you were at a meeting , and and you you do n't think , at least , that you said anything funny and the meeting was about , you know , some some funny thing about semantics or something , or uh postdoc f : it is true that tec that the content is technical , i and so i and we 're not having these discussions which </s>
<s> what was said about the equipment ? </s> postdoc f : ba - based on some of the tran uh i in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one i 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , phd b : no i 'm just grad c : right . right . well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a : yeah . phd b : i would i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . grad c : well then professor e : oh . so yeah so the only beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars . yeah . um , that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and um i heard from uw that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c : well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . professor e : yeah . but anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw . so . um . but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony , well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's that tha that can be quite good . th - this yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . so anyway i think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . so yeah . so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours , or something of there 's got to be more than thirty hour grad c : of of non - digits ? yeah , absolutely . i mean , the digits do n't take up that much time . postdoc f : ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , do n't have the exact numbers , but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i had n't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh `` ninety - two `` . and you know , so how you could grad c : nine two , right . postdoc f : so if you just say `` nine two `` , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them i i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b : um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but i 've noticed in the past that when i 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , { comment } a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis phd a : yeah . postdoc f : you 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and i use those too . y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word right ? it 's one token from the from the corpus . phd b : oh so you already have that , ok . postdoc f : well that 's that 's a way that 's you know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy i wan na do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which are n't in the lexicon . phd b : mm - hmm . cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , postdoc f : exactly . and then you ca then you can do a s phd a : yeah . grad c : right . postdoc f : i already had that convention but i i have n't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz i think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . that was what i was always planing on . so that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say `` curly bracket laugh curly bracket `` , then y you know it 's it 's you you risk less error if you handle it by a filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a voc space , so man so many ways that error prone . yeah now timit 's clear um and plp is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say `` nine two `` or you can say `` ninety - two `` , and uh i 'd handle the numbers individually . so gloss of whatever . and uh , thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and i have n't i have n't been able to use that yet cuz i 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . grad c : right . postdoc f : and um , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . and i have t ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that . and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . so um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up `` gobbledy - gook `` . grad c : right . postdoc f : it was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz i have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . so they tried to approximate it , but it was yes . more of an attempt to i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , but ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . professor e : and and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ? postdoc f : yeah . they are . mm - hmm . they 're very efficient . there 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . professor e : so what what what 's the deal with with your phd a : and i 'm i 'm working on it . so , i hope the basic thing is this hmm base . grad c : you know what i mean ? across all of them . phd a : i 'm not sure about the term . professor e : i i ca n't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . i mean if people have uh , i mean , for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it . and then um if i thought it was ok , i 'd say `` it 's ok `` . and , i uh i mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was ok or not and needing to listen to it was gon na be extremely rare . grad c : and so that that 's a minor part of it , i just wanted some web interface so that people you did n't actually have to send everyone the text . so m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um i would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , `` here 's the web page `` , um , `` you need a password `` . so th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wan na provide this information if they want it . professor e : really ? i mean , it grad c : well , i do n't think it 's that much harder than , paper . so . postdoc f : i have one question . so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? because i i do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the yeah . professor e : but the way i imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gon na go `` oh yeah , i did n't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? `` and then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? ok there 's i mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . phd a : yeah . yeah . professor e : but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . um if if uh you do n't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , i mean whenever i 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , i 've always ended up printing it out . i mean , so it 's it 's i mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gon na be sitting at the desk all the time , you wan na figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where i i mean , this is how i was imagining it , anyway . and then i figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go `` hmm you know i 'm really not sure about this section here , `` and then that group would need it s it seems like i if i 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . so that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c : well , no fre for the most for the most frequent case they just say `` it 's ok `` and then they 're done . and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . postdoc f : the other thing too is it seems like professor e : uh i do n't know about that . right ? yeah . yeah , but that 's our decision then . right ? grad c : um , i do n't think so . i mean , because if i object to the conversation . professor e : i think it is . um i mean it 's also a mixture of people , i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . you know ? grad c : well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former . that 's right . phd b : what um when you display it on the web page , what are what are you showing them ? utterances , or ? i think what morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gon na be bleeped . professor e : but i and and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . i think some researchers who are gon na be working with this corpus years from now are really gon na be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there { comment } that 's missing from the dialogue . phd a : yeah . professor e : and they can bleep out stuff they do n't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so `` well i did n't like what he said . `` grad c : well i do n't see any way of avoiding that . i mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they do n't like . so that the phd b : only if they want it . grad c : what i 'm saying is that i ca n't just email them the password because that 's not secure . so they have to call me and ask . professor e : we 're we 're trying i we 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . postdoc f : not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . yeah . professor e : not just for fun , ok ? but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory . um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , ok ? then , if someone uh wants to review it , uh , and i know you do n't like this , but i 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . and then if they say that `` i have a potential problem with these things , `` then , you you say `` ok well you might wan na hear this in context to s think if you need that , `` you issue them a password , i in the grad c : but the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . i would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . obviously they do n't have to . yeah . professor e : we have grad c : so i think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just do n't think that 's gon na happen . postdoc f : yeah . grad c : it seems to me that sending them email , saying `` if you have an o - ok reply to this email and say ok , phd a : yeah . postdoc f : i mean we could offer that but but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . and and i ha professor e : yeah . postdoc f : i do n't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . i mean i i thought that you were maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it 's professor e : that 's right . phd b : i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them . grad c : they just have to make sure that it is available to them . professor e : yeah , ok , so . wh um i think i have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . so i i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , i mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . grad c : right . professor e : and then then my concern about which postdoc f : yeah . i agree . grad c : well , but they wo n't get that feedback . and then at some point i 'll incorporate them all and put bleeps . i mean i do n't wan na have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data because um , then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we 're already short on disk space . so i i wan na i just keep the times until we actually wan na release the data and then we bleep it . professor e : i 'm i 'm i 'm i thought i i thought about it with one of my background processes grad c : i do n't think so . professor e : yeah . grad c : and so i do n't think they need another signature . professor e : and well and furthermore i it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth that that uh if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh `` ok i agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and i agree that 's ok , `` uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now grad c : right . professor e : so it 's it 's ok . grad c : and so i do n't necessarily wan na do one per line . but i do n't know how else to do it . postdoc f : but but it was all the words were all visible , but they did n't end up i some there was a slip in the transcript . grad c : any sub - wor yeah , ok . i mean you could do it with pgp or things like that but it 's too complex . postdoc f : i mean . so it 's like i in a way it 's it 's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript , to have that be the </s>
<s> what did the team say about recording conventions ? </s> postdoc f : that sounds like a spy code . ba - based on some of the tran uh i in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things , and in pact in fact this one i 'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings , professor e : i mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do { comment } what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they ca n't be used . grad c : well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . phd a : yeah . postdoc f : i 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics , i mean . maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more . phd b : i would i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there 'll be more things of interest to him . professor e : yeah . actually it this this maybe brings up another topic which is um so we 're done with that topic . the other topic i was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that . yeah . why why do n't we do that . grad c : and get people 's opinions on on what they think of them . um , then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless . another wireless setup . i mean it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired . professor e : yeah . um , that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and um i heard from uw that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . grad c : well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff , and so , you know , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that . professor e : yeah . but anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw . so . um . but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony , uh , ok , so that 's being done professionally and well , it could if they do a lot of it , it 's grad c : i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . professor e : that tha that can be quite good . th - this yeah , ok . good . yeah . so let 's go with that . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . mm - hmm . so he has a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that . professor e : so anyway i think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . phd b : um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but i 've noticed in the past that when i 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , { comment } a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis phd a : yeah . phd b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . postdoc f : yeah , those are e extremely efficient and i and i i agree that 's a very good use of it . well that 's that 's a way that 's you know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy i wan na do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which are n't in the lexicon . exactly . and then you ca then you can do a s phd a : yeah . postdoc f : i already had that convention phd b : oh that 's great . mm - hmm . postdoc f : so man so many ways that error prone . and you can um , have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes . but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand , because , you know i mean , jus it 's not a good way of saying but it 's it 's the specific uh way of stating these these letters . grad c : right . so it sounds good . postdoc f : and uh , thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and i have n't i have n't been able to use that yet cuz i 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . uh and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . so they tried to approximate it , but it was phd b : sort of how it sounds . yeah . postdoc f : yes . more of an attempt to i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these the a this this was a sound these are the sounds , then cuz `` neural nets `` and oh she has some things that are oh `` downsampled `` , she got that right . grad c : obscure , yeah . postdoc f : yeah . they are . mm - hmm . they 're very efficient . there 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . phd a : and i 'm i 'm working on it . so , i hope the basic thing is this hmm base . so . but basically that 's one of the main changes . i 'm not sure about the term . grad c : a single password . each person will have a single password , user name and password . and then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . and that way each person only has to remember one password . professor e : i i ca n't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . i mean if people have uh , i mean , for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it . and then um if i thought it was ok , i 'd say `` it 's ok `` . and , i uh i mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was ok or not and needing to listen to it was gon na be extremely rare . grad c : i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . well , i do n't think it 's that much harder than , paper . so . postdoc f : i have one question . so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?

yeah . yeah , but that 's our decision then . right ? i think it is . postdoc f : the i agree that the consent forms were uh , i cons agree with what adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or did n't say them . professor e : um i mean it 's also a mixture of people , i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . you know ? grad c : well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former . professor e : it depends on what meetings . postdoc f : that 's true . professor e : there 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me . um , i think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this . phd b : i think what morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gon na be bleeped . professor e : but i and and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . i think some researchers who are gon na be working with this corpus years from now are really gon na be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there { comment } that 's missing from the dialogue . you know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , phd a : yeah . professor e : but it might be , uh it might be really a a pain . and , you know where it 's really gon na hurt somebody , in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , { comment } we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . but i really think we wan na make it the rare incidence . and and uh , i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! that they 're gon na go through and bleep out stuff . and they can bleep out stuff they do n't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so `` well i did n't like what he said . `` grad c : well i do n't see any way of avoiding that . i mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they do n't like . so that the the problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me . whereas this web interface , i just get email , it 's all formatted , it 's all ready to go and i can just insert it . professor e : you 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle , and useful for someone else if they need it . but i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it . y but you do n't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i 'm saying . phd b : only if they want it . grad c : what i 'm saying is that i ca n't just email them the password because that 's not secure . so they have to call me and ask . well , we do because of privacy . we ca n't just make it openly available on the web . postdoc f : mm - hmm . professor e : we 're we 're trying i we 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . postdoc f : not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . yeah . professor e : not just for fun , ok ?

<s> what ’ s the current state of transcriptions ? </s> professor e : i mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do { comment } what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance . and if they are , then they ca n't be used . and and i 'm sure help out his own time . by not showing up if it 's a meeting that he 's he 's so , uh in order i 'd i think that this is a wish on his part . uh . it 's actually gon na be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and and but um , we could try anyway , uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting , uh , say the day before . grad c : well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday , or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items . professor e : ok . you you wan na volunteer to do that ? grad c : i 'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done . professor e : yeah . um , that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and um i heard from uw that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . yeah . but anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw . so . um . but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony , grad c : i mean i it 's just their repair shop . right ? their maintenance people . postdoc f : mm - hmm . yeah . uh , it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that . grad c : i have n't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e : i it could n't of of non - digits . yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f : ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , do n't have the exact numbers , but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i had n't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh `` ninety - two `` . and you know , so how you could grad c : nine two , postdoc f : so if you just say `` nine two `` , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them i i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b : um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but i 've noticed in the past that when i 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , { comment } a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis postdoc f : you 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and i use those too . y you mean just uh on each on each line there 's a one word right ? it 's one token from the from the corpus . yeah , those are e extremely efficient and i and i i agree that 's a very good use of it . phd b : oh so you already have that , ok . postdoc f : well that 's that 's a way that 's you know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy i wan na do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which are n't in the lexicon . phd b : mm - hmm . cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , i in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier . postdoc f : absolutely . i agree . that 's a very good that 's a very good uh , suggestion . and that was that 's my strategy for handling a lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed . i did n't get to that point but so there are numbers , then there are acronyms , and then um , there 's a he she wants the uh , actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is , so i curly b inside the curly brackets i 'm gon na put either `` voc `` for vocalized , like cough or like laugh or whatever , `` nonvoc `` for door - slam , and `` gloss `` for things that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error . i already had that convention phd b : oh that 's great . postdoc f : but i i have n't been asking these people to do it systematically cuz i think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter . that was what i was always planing on . so that , you know you get a whole long list exactly what you 're saying , you get a whole list of things that say `` curly bracket laugh curly bracket `` , so man so many ways that error prone . yeah now timit 's clear um and plp is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say `` nine two `` or you can say `` ninety - two `` , and uh , thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and i have n't i have n't been able to use that yet cuz i 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . well you see that 's part of the cleaning process . i spent um actually um i have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers , grad c : oh good . good . postdoc f : uh and so because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions . and um , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . and i have t ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that . and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . so um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up `` gobbledy - gook `` . and the other one did n't . and on this side , this one 's picking up things like `` neural nets `` and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial did n't . phd b : when for the person who missed `` gobbledy - gook `` what did they put ? postdoc f : it was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz i have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . phd b : oh good . postdoc f : but ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . phd a : and i 'm i 'm working on it . so , i hope how do you call it ? i 'm not sure . with the , uh professor e : fletcher munson ? no . phd a : i 'm not sure about the term . professor e : oh , ok . phd a : uh , i 'll look it up . and say it to you . professor e : yeah , alright . phd a : uh , ok , and yeah . that 's that 's basically the the the thing . yeah , and i and i tried t to normalize uh uh the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , um , within one channel , professor e : uh - huh . uh - huh . um , let 's see . i think the uh were were you basically done with the transcription part ? so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing . grad c : right . so the the idea is that we need to have we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they do n't want . so i 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . and then , it 's a form , html form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . and so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , a single password . each person will have a single password , user name and password . and then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . and that way each person only has to remember one password . professor e : i i ca n't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . i mean if people have uh , i mean , for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it . and then um if i thought it was ok , i 'd say `` it 's ok `` . and , i uh i mean it depends how this really ends up working out , but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was ok or not and needing to listen to it was gon na be extremely rare . grad c : and so that that 's a minor part of it , i just wanted some web interface so that people you did n't actually have to send everyone the text . so m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um i would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , `` here 's the web page `` , um , `` you need a password `` . so th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wan na provide this information if they want it . professor e : that 's i think what i was sort of saying is that if you just say `` here is a here is `` i mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but i just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , `` here 's what was said in this transcription is it ok with you ? and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's ok `` . grad c : i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide . cuz you 're gon na get , you know , if i i 'm i 'm in a bunch of meetings and i do n't wan na get a stack of these . i wan na just be able to go to go to the web site { comment } and visit it as i want . well , i do n't think it 's that much harder than , paper . so . postdoc f : i have one question . so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? because i i do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e : but the way i imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gon na go `` oh yeah , i did n't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? `` and then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? ok there 's i mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . ok there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh `` well , yeah , i really would like to see that . `` and for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document , i mean unless you 're searching . searching , of course , should be electronic , but if you 're not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that , but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . um if if uh you do n't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , i mean whenever i 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , i 've always ended up printing it out . i mean , so it 's it 's i mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gon na be sitting at the desk all the time , you wan na figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where i i mean , this is how i was imagining it , anyway . and then i figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go `` hmm you know i 'm really not sure about this section here , `` and then that group would need it s it seems like i if i 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . so that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c : for the most frequent case they just say `` it 's ok `` and then they 're done . and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . professor e : mm - hmm . right ? yeah . yeah , but that 's our decision then . right ? grad c : um , i do n't think so . i mean , because if i object to the conversation . professor e : i think it is . grad c : if i say `` we were having a conversation , and i consider that conversation private , `` and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , i wan na be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f : the i agree that the consent forms were uh , i cons agree with what adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or did n't say them . professor e : um i mean it 's also a mixture of people , i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . you know ? grad c : well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former . professor e : it depends on what meetings . postdoc f : that 's true . phd b : so far . professor e : see because you 're gon you 're uh really . you 're gon na end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go . because nob you know it there was a one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by , but overall people are talking about technical topics . nobody 's gon na get hurt . nobody 's being l libeled . you know , this is this we 're we 're covering we 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case . if we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gon na end up encouraging a headache . that i think that 's i 'm sort of psyching myself out here , i i 'm trying to uh grad c : i guess i do n't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache , bleeped out . professor e : but i i think that 's well , it 's phd b : i think what morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gon na be bleeped . professor e : but i and and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing . i think some researchers who are gon na be working with this corpus years from now are really gon na be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there { comment } that 's missing from the dialogue . grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : you know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing , phd a : yeah . professor e : but it might be , uh it might be really a a pain . and , you know where it 's really gon na hurt somebody , in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , { comment } we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out . but i really think we wan na make it the rare incidence . and and uh , i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do , and so much fun ! that they 're gon na go through and bleep out stuff . postdoc f : so much fun . professor e : and they can bleep out stuff they do n't like too , right from somebody else , as you say , you know , so `` well i did n't like what he said . `` grad c : well i do n't see any way of avoiding that . i mean , we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they do n't like . so that the professor e : yeah . no , no , i i i do n't grad c : the only question is professor e : y but you do n't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i 'm saying . phd b : only if they want it . grad c : what i 'm saying is that i ca n't just email them the password because that 's not secure . so they have to call me and ask . professor e : no , no . you 're missing the point . we 're we 're trying i we 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this . postdoc f : not everyone gets a password , unless they ask for it . professor e : not just for fun , ok ? but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory . um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded , ok ? then , if someone uh wants to review it , uh , and i know you do n't like this , but i 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out . and then if they say that `` i have a potential problem with these things , `` then , you you say `` ok well you might wan na hear this in context to s think if you need that , `` you issue them a password , i in the grad c : but the the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me . because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything . i would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to . obviously they do n't have to . so i think you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just do n't think that 's gon na happen . professor e : there 's a problem with it . postdoc f : i 'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing . cuz i think if they feel that uh , it 's i th i th you know , if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and did n't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they did n't pursue that next level and get the password and do that , um , but but they might be able to argue `` oh well it was cumbersome , and i was busy and it was gon na take me too much time to trace it down `` . so it could that the burden would come back onto us . so i 'm a little bit worried about uh , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint . grad c : it seems to me that sending them email , saying `` if you have an o - ok reply to this email and say ok , professor e : because uh - huh . grad c : if you have a problem with it contact me and i 'll give you a password `` , seems like is a perfectly , reasonable compromise . and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves . postdoc f : i mean we could offer that but but there 's uh , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , um , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript . and and i ha i do n't know that there 's a chance of really skipping that stage . i mean i i thought that you were maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it 's professor e : that 's right . yeah , ok , so . wh um i think i have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um , it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded . so i i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , i mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data . postdoc f : great . great , great . grad c : well , but they wo n't get that feedback . professor e : oh good . so you have n't made it so much fun . grad c : and so i do n't think they need another signature . professor e : and well and furthermore i it 's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth that that uh if it 's if it 's that sort of thing where you 're you 're saying uh `` ok i agree , we want eighty hours of this person at such - and - such amount , and i agree that 's ok , `` uh if it 's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it 's often done in email now so it 's it 's ok . postdoc f : great . grad c : so i guess i probably should at the minimum , think about how to present it in a printed form . i 'm not really sure what 's best with that . the problem is a lot of them are really short , and so i do n't necessarily wan na do one per line . but i do n't know how else to do it . postdoc f : and i realize we should n't emphasize that people { comment } you know , should n't borrow trouble . what it comes down to but oh , you know , or what if there was an error in the transcript that did n't get detected and there was a whole uh i segment a against some personal i th </s>
<s> what was needed for the transcripts ? </s> grad c : right . postdoc f : good . grad c : right . phd a : yeah . professor e : ok . you you wan na volunteer to do that ? grad c : sure . right . and we have five , we 're getting one more . professor e : yeah . um , that 's the only thing with them . but the quality seems really good and um i heard from uw that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased . they 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf . phd b : sri , really ? professor e : yeah . but anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw . so . um . but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony , so anyway i think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave . grad c : i have n't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits . professor e : yeah , yeah . ok . postdoc f : ok , and the transcribers h i , uh , do n't have the exact numbers , but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh , transcribing from them right now . the next step is to that i 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . what i mean by clean is that they 're spell - checked , that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout , and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh , liz requested in terms of um , um in terms of having a s a systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which i had n't been specific about . um , for example , i they 'll say uh `` ninety - two `` . and you know , so how you could grad c : nine two , right . postdoc f : so if you just say `` nine two `` , the there are many s ways that could have been expressed . an - and i just had them i i mean , a certain number of them did put the words down , but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by , um , a gloss th and things . phd b : um , one suggestion and you may already be doing this , but i 've noticed in the past that when i 've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things , if you um , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , { comment } a lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis phd a : yeah . phd b : oh so you already have that , ok . postdoc f : well that 's that 's a way that 's you know , the spell - check basically does that but but in addition yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy i wan na do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which are n't in the lexicon . phd b : mm - hmm . cuz a lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and uh , postdoc f : exactly . and then you ca then you can do a s phd a : yeah . grad c : right . postdoc f : i already had that convention phd b : oh that 's great . postdoc f : so man so many ways that error prone . yeah now timit 's clear um and plp is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known , in or or have variant u u uses like the numbers you can say `` nine two `` or you can say `` ninety - two `` , grad c : right . so it sounds good . postdoc f : and uh , thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel - based um uh s s speech - nonspeech segmentation um , up and running and i have n't i have n't been able to use that yet cuz i 'm working s re this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized . oh yes . grad c : okay , good . oh good . good . postdoc f : and um , and so they 'll be a difference in commas , but it 's word - by - word the same , in in huge patches of the data . and i have t ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that . and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon , and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech . so um , the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up `` gobbledy - gook `` . and the other one did n't . and on this side , this one 's picking up things like `` neural nets `` and the one that 's good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial did n't . phd b : when for the person who missed `` gobbledy - gook `` what did they put ? postdoc f : it was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses , cuz i have this convention that , i if they 're not sure what it was , they put it in parentheses . phd b : oh good . postdoc f : but ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data . professor e : is that right ? postdoc f : yeah . they are . mm - hmm . they 're very efficient . there 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others . phd a : so . but basically that 's one of the main changes . how do you call it ? i 'm not sure . with the , uh professor e : fletcher munson ? no . phd a : i 'm not sure about the term . grad c : good . right . so the the idea is that we need to have we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they do n't want . so i 've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages , uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them , and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded . and then , it 's a form , html form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded . and so , uh , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue . and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password , a single password . each person will have a single password , user name and password . and then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it . and that way each person only has to remember one password . professor e : i i ca n't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed . i mean if people have uh , i mean , for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it . and then um if i thought it was ok , i 'd say `` it 's ok `` . grad c : and so that that 's a minor part of it , i just wanted some web interface so that people you did n't actually have to send everyone the text . so m what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , um i would take them , and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted , and just uh , tell them , `` here 's the web page `` , um , `` you need a password `` . so th th question number one is how do we distribute the passwords , and question number two is how else do we wan na provide this information if they want it . well , i do n't think it 's that much harder than , paper . so . professor e : really ? postdoc f : i have one question . so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ? because i i do think that there 's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the professor e : so here 's the way i was imagining it , and maybe i 'm wrong , postdoc f : yeah . professor e : but the way i imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gon na go `` oh yeah , i did n't say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead , where 's the where 's the release ? `` and then there 'll be a subset of people , right ? ok there 's i mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly . phd a : yeah . yeah . professor e : but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing . um if if uh you do n't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document , i mean whenever i 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , i 've always ended up printing it out . i mean , so it 's it 's i mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gon na be sitting at the desk all the time , you wan na figure you have a train ride , and there 's all these situations where where i i mean , this is how i was imagining it , anyway . and then i figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go `` hmm you know i 'm really not sure about this section here , `` and then that group would need it s it seems like i if i 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case . so that uh , now we have to worry about privacy , grad c : for the most frequent case they just say `` it 's ok `` and then they 're done . and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method . postdoc f : the other thing too is it seems like professor e : right ? yeah . yeah , but that 's our decision then . right ? grad c : um , i do n't think so . i mean , because if i object to the conversation . professor e : i think it is . grad c : if i say `` we were having a conversation , and i consider that conversation private , `` and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , i wan na be able to bleep out your side . postdoc f : the i agree that the consent forms were uh , i cons agree with what adam 's saying , that um , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or did n't say them . professor e : um i mean it 's also a mixture of people , i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web , and others do not . others would consider it this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain . you know ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> nick williams : the messages that the government is conveying to us and the messages we convey as directors and councils are important as well . so , we always tell them that it 's the progression of the children in the future that 's important , not just reaching up to the level . so , it 's more complex than that , and it 's important to share that . and in fairness to estyn—estyn has changed its mind as well . so , messages such as those are being conveyed now , and i think that the schools do understand now the expectation and what 's expected of them . lynne neagle am : and do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across wales ? nick williams : certainly with schools , i know across wales we 've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice , so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through , whereas in the past—i 'm thinking myself , now , as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours . i did n't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through . so , i think we are more informed as a profession . sharon davies : i 'm not sure whether it 's being worse affected , but certainly there 's pressure , in particular with the new act coming in , and that 's going to place more pressure on the system . nick williams : the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . sian gwenllian am : and maybe i can ask the wlga : are the difficulties that can arise between the money that is kept back by local authorities and the funding that goes directly to schools—can that therefore affect the kind of provision that 's happening from authority to authority ? david hopkins : it should n't , but it could . it 's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react . if they 're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures , they will react in a particular way . culturally , we 've got to get to the point , i think , particularly with the new curriculum coming in , where we say , 'look , forget the narrow measures that you 're being judged by . we 're trying to agree with partners , including estyn and the welsh government , a broader range of measures . ' that , in a sense , may provide opportunities for schools , and local authorities , to look more constructively at this whole area . so , that 's one area , but you 're right , i think the aln legislation will put pressures on , not just local authorities and schools , but also on the post-16 sector , because we 're talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well . so , we 've got a host of issues , i think , there to consider and work our way through . nick williams : well , one of the things i think that has improved a lot is the networking within the pru sector . we meet on a regular basis , and that 's nationally . and the eotas group meets regionally as well . so , there 's definitely a better sharing of practice . we put on some very , very good conferences as one form of professional learning . but it 's also important— . and we 're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider , or it 's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits , joint visits , to provision and also using the expertise that we do have within the sector to work more closely with our schools , and vice versa , particularly around the curriculum . and i think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides , providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well . but in the past , there might well have been some staff who perhaps had n't had those school experiences and vice versa . david hopkins : i think , chair , at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting , but it 's early days yet for looking at that . i mean , that 's an ideal , obviously , but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully , and it brings— . the principle is fine , but it does bring a host of other issues with it , if you see what i mean . but it 's certainly a model worth looking at . it 's been tried elsewhere , and we keep an eye on that , but we do n't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that . lynne neagle am : and which authority is that ? nick williams : sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . janet finch-saunders am : okay . what would be the advantages or disadvantages , then , of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers , and for eotas providers to have approved status ? nick williams : obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . janet finch-saunders am : okay . and is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring , monitoring or evaluating the eotas provision organised by individual schools ? nick williams : yes , but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use , in our experience . so , if it 's mtp or something through the college , like a mechanics course or something like that , we 're probably using it ourselves . so , it is quality assured , if you like , by two sides . sharon davies : in torfaen , our secondary schools have set out their own tcp—torfaen curriculum panel—which looks at alternative provision . so , you 've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings . the meetings are facilitated and they 're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because , sometimes , it 's worked in the past , but what they 're seeing now is that it 's not quite working now , and it 's understanding why . is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through ? or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more ? so , it 's looking as well at , coming back to that curriculum offer , is it the right curriculum offer for those learners ? and the training of the staff , do we have the right staff ? it 's capacity , then . it 's just quality assuring the provision . just because it 's worked in the past—it 's about keeping that momentum going . janet finch-saunders am : okay . and should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition ? sharon davies : we 're very similar to that . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? you wo n't get any arguments from us on that . siân gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum . nick williams : to be honest , they are broad and balanced . they have to be broad and balanced currently . but there 's working together now in terms of the new curriculum , and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well . sharon davies : collaboration , i think , is the answer , between the prus and the schools . collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners have what they need . sian gwenllian am : yes . i can see how collaborative working with the units can work—because they 're under your control—the problem is the other parts of the system , in a way . with the curriculum ? nick williams : yes , and in terms of collaboration . i 'm not saying that it 's perfect , but it is developing . david hopkins : if a child has additional needs , of course they should be met , whatever the setting . but i take your point . there 's a possibility that— . again , going back to the previous question , we would know within , say a pru or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition—whatever form that took—then those needs definitely should be being met . i ca n't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not—i don ’ t know—but they should be . once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system , then , again , if a child has a particular need , of course that need should be met , but it becomes increasingly difficult . so , i think there possibly is an issue there , but i do n't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that . but there certainly may well be an issue there . i think there will be variations in provision , but i would say that , within the local authority maintained sector , that provision should be being made . if it 's not , the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that . dawn bowden am : and on that point , actually , we did hear from estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision . there really is n't the capacity for them to access professional training . is that your experience ? and if so , what can we do about that ? nick williams : yes , but again , it 's a capacity issue , because if we take them out of the provision , it 's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands . so , it 's not an easy conundrum . dawn bowden am : no . but you 're saying , really , take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting . i understand that . sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . nick williams : again , even in the region there 's variation there because we 've got three health boards over the footprint of the south-west and mid wales region . so , it varies . that 's my understanding , anyway , and i think that 's similar across wales . ours has n't been great , to be honest with you . and that 's one of the positive steps , that health boards have to have a declo now—do n't ask me , i ca n't remember what the exact abbreviation is—but we 've met with the designated education clinical lead officer , and i think those partnerships will be strong in the future . but it 's also us then having a well-being strategy and support that is universal . so , there 's counselling and so on to make sure that the learners are going through , if you like— . not that we 're trying to stop them going through , but we 're trying to deal with them appropriately at the different stages so that they 're not inundated either . sian gwenllian am : but if we 're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people , then it creates a great big challenge , does n't it ? we 're looking at something very limited here , but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what 's happening . would you agree with that ? lynne neagle am : sharon , the camhs in-reach project is operational in gwent , but my understanding is that they do n't include prus . is that right ? sharon davies : i think any form of professional learning , it 's positive , and , therefore , as we alluded to earlier , it 's that expertise training for the pru then and for the staff there . it 's having a positive impact . at the minute , i do n't know what the overall impact is . i think it 's early days , but it seems to be positive . david hopkins : i 'm not aware of issues , if i 'm honest , but then again , it may be something we 've not investigated . i 'm quite happy to look at that . dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . i do n't think we 're really in a position to answer fully as to what 's going on . i think that part of the problem is there 's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this , and i think that 's really why there 's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum . </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about the funding issues ? </s> lynne neagle am : okay . anybody got anything to add to that , or— ? and do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across wales ? okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on funding from siân gwenllian . sharon davies : i 'm not sure whether it 's being worse affected , but certainly there 's pressure , in particular with the new act coming in , and that 's going to place more pressure on the system . sian gwenllian am : but maybe we need to spend more in light of the new act ? nick williams : the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . sian gwenllian am : and maybe i can ask the wlga : are the difficulties that can arise between the money that is kept back by local authorities and the funding that goes directly to schools—can that therefore affect the kind of provision that 's happening from authority to authority ? okay . but just the pressures coming in with the new act et cetera could mean more expulsions . nick williams : well , again , i can only speak for ourselves . we 've had a big investment of time , and there will be money and through band b , we 're building a brand-new pru provision in swansea , which will be open in january 2021. so , we 've recognised that , so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools . there 's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school , and we continue to support them during that process . but then , when they 're back in school , that support does n't stop—that support continues , and then there 's a managed reduction in that support . and that 's proven very successful . david hopkins : i think , chair , at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting , but it 's early days yet for looking at that . i mean , that 's an ideal , obviously , but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully , and it brings— . the principle is fine , but it does bring a host of other issues with it , if you see what i mean . but it 's certainly a model worth looking at . it 's been tried elsewhere , and we keep an eye on that , but we do n't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that . i do n't think i 'm allowed to say at this point . sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . janet finch-saunders am : okay . what would be the advantages or disadvantages , then , of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers , and for eotas providers to have approved status ? nick williams : obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . janet finch-saunders am : and how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run eotas ? independent . nick williams : the schools would have to make sure that— janet finch-saunders am : okay . and should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition ? sharon davies : can i just ask what you mean by individual tuition ? janet finch-saunders am : i suppose individual tuition in terms of each individual , i would assume that means . lynne neagle am : i think the purpose of the question is around home tuition , yes . sharon davies : i suppose the difficulty with home tuition is , as a local authority , we 're restricted on how much access we get into the home . janet finch-saunders am : well , i appreciate that , and that 's the— [ inaudible . ] what about if they 're in a private setting ? nick williams : i do n't really know the answer to that , i 'm sorry . i can only speak for swansea . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? david hopkins : in general terms— . you differentiate there between eotas and prus . prus : clearly , we know that they are following a set curriculum ; they are inspected ; they are under the control of the local authorities . so , we 're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there . where home tuition is provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , again , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . you ca n't always guarantee what then happens in the home . as you say , particular things happen there , and they may not get that . but that 's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle . it 's more difficult where , i suspect , it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned . the commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place ; it 's all about the monitoring then . but that 's a very general , broad-brush answer . i could n't give you a definitive one of what 's happening across wales . my colleagues can probably tell you what 's happening in their localities , and that would be helpful . but in general : prus , yes , we 'd be satisfied ; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority , yes , we would be satisfied ; other areas , we would not be able to give a definitive answer on , is my guess . i think there will be variations in provision , but i would say that , within the local authority maintained sector , that provision should be being made . if it 's not , the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that . nick williams : yes , but again , it 's a capacity issue , because if we take them out of the provision , it 's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands . so , it 's not an easy conundrum . sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . lynne neagle am : siân , you had a supplementary . sharon , the camhs in-reach project is operational in gwent , but my understanding is that they do n't include prus . is that right ? sharon davies : i do n't know if that is the— . janet finch-saunders am : what provision in the north ? nick williams : for myself , and i 'd hazard a guess , torfaen , we 're relatively compact , aren't we , so it 's not such an issue . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . and what are your views on the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support , because i know that the samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support ? how can the balance be addressed ? dawn bowden am : can i just ask , as a follow on from that , whether you 've got any views on the potential impact of individual tuition on learners ' well-being ? so , home tuition , for instance : are pupils going to be on their own doing that ? that might be in their best interest , or do you have any concerns that it might not be ? lynne neagle am : thank you . we 've got some questions now from siân gwenllian . i think some of them have been covered , but— just before we finish , then , is there anything you wanted to add in terms of what the committee could recommend about professional development for staff that would enhance this provision in this area ? </s>
<s> what did david hopkins think of the new act ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . the messages that the government is conveying to us and the messages we convey as directors and councils are important as well . so , we always tell them that it 's the progression of the children in the future that 's important , not just reaching up to the level . so , it 's more complex than that , and it 's important to share that . and in fairness to estyn—estyn has changed its mind as well . so , messages such as those are being conveyed now , and i think that the schools do understand now the expectation and what 's expected of them . lynne neagle am : and do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across wales ? sharon davies : i would say the majority have . i 'm not sure whether it 's being worse affected , but certainly there 's pressure , in particular with the new act coming in , and that 's going to place more pressure on the system . nick williams : the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ?

' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . i can only speak for swansea . we know , as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in , they have to put down where that provision is . and obviously , as part of the visits , as well , to the schools by the challenge advisers , the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision . the schools would have to make sure that— yes , because schools do take safeguarding very , very seriously . they see the importance of it . it 's their prime driver in many ways . yes , but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use , in our experience . so , if it 's mtp or something through the college , like a mechanics course or something like that , we 're probably using it ourselves . so , it is quality assured , if you like , by two sides . sharon davies : i suppose the difficulty with home tuition is , as a local authority , we 're restricted on how much access we get into the home . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? you wo n't get any arguments from us on that . siân gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum . david hopkins : in general terms— . you differentiate there between eotas and prus . prus : clearly , we know that they are following a set curriculum ; they are inspected ; they are under the control of the local authorities . so , we 're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there . where home tuition is provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , again , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . you ca n't always guarantee what then happens in the home . as you say , particular things happen there , and they may not get that . but that 's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle . it 's more difficult where , i suspect , it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned . the commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place ; it 's all about the monitoring then . but that 's a very general , broad-brush answer . i could n't give you a definitive one of what 's happening across wales . my colleagues can probably tell you what 's happening in their localities , and that would be helpful . but in general : prus , yes , we 'd be satisfied ; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority , yes , we would be satisfied ; other areas , we would not be able to give a definitive answer on , is my guess . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . dawn bowden am : and on that point , actually , we did hear from estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision . there really is n't the capacity for them to access professional training . is that your experience ? and if so , what can we do about that ? lynne neagle am : siân , you had a supplementary . okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? liz williams : i think there 's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable . so , i suppose , if you consider that , this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there 's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps are n't attaining brilliant grades . so , i think that 's something that needs to be looked at further . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . janet finch-saunders am : it 's very bad in north wales . our figures are very worrying . lynne neagle am : thank you . dawn . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . and as ian just said , although there 's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority , i suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well . but for the parents to support their child , either if they 're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in eotas , and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible , the parent has to have the right amount of information . they must know where to go for support themselves , and i think that a parent ca n't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they 're not provided with all of the information . and i 'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority , but that 's something worth thinking about as well . </s>
<s> what was considered by david hopkins as the factor that affected exclusions ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . lynne neagle am : okay . so , to what extent , then , do local authorities have clear strategies for support and reintegration , and a continuum of provision to meet the needs of learners who are either at risk of exclusion , or disengagement ? okay . in terms of parents , what are local authorities doing to actually engage parents of children and young people who are either eotas or at risk of becoming eotas ? sharon davies : i would say the majority have . sian gwenllian am : may i begin , maybe , with a question , generally speaking— ? we 're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general . so , can this lead to more exclusions , because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges , and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions ? and is the fact that there 's variation from term to term , from week to week sometimes , in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge , and maybe that that leads to more exclusions ? lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : yes . thank you . in your view— sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . so , in your view , though , what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing eotas provision ? nick williams : the schools would have to make sure that— lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? sian gwenllian am : no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . it 's really around support . it follows on a little bit from what siân was saying . can i also just refer back to the point that david was making earlier on about aln and the extent to which aln support is available to learners in eotas ? the information that we 've had is that it 's difficult enough in mainstream schools , but in an eotas setting , it 's particularly challenging . so , how can that be improved ? what can we do to address that ? the reason i 'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an eotas setting—that 's why they 're there , quite often . so , it 's almost more important that that aln provision follows them through . david hopkins : if a child has additional needs , of course they should be met , whatever the setting . but i take your point . there 's a possibility that— . again , going back to the previous question , we would know within , say a pru or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition—whatever form that took—then those needs definitely should be being met . i ca n't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not—i don ’ t know—but they should be . once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system , then , again , if a child has a particular need , of course that need should be met , but it becomes increasingly difficult . so , i think there possibly is an issue there , but i do n't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that . but there certainly may well be an issue there . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . dawn bowden am : and on that point , actually , we did hear from estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision . there really is n't the capacity for them to access professional training . is that your experience ? and if so , what can we do about that ? sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . sian gwenllian am : yes . just to return to teacher training , and you say that new teachers ca n't go straight into a unit , and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect . but generally speaking , if there 's an increase in challenging behaviour , are new teachers able— ? they do n't have the experience , but are they equipped well enough to deal with that ? because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour , and again , i wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that . and we need—not just in this aspect—but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour . do you know what i 'm saying ? dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think it 's an issue where it 's very important both to focus on the individual , but also on the macro situation , and , as sarah mentioned , i think the whole-school approach , which is something that 's been discussed within this committee , as part of the 'mind over matter ' work , is something that is hugely important . and that 's why that should be—there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach . because understanding— . that prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will , hopefully , be very effective in providing support levels , ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning , all the way through primary school , all the way through secondary school , to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that 's at the forefront of people 's considerations whenever they 're considering what a pupil is doing , and why they might be doing it . and that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences . but , generally , just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first , i think , is hugely important in this context . i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . and what are your views on the balance between funding being used for diagnosis and support , because i know that the samaritans report suggested that funding tends to go into diagnosis rather than support ? how can the balance be addressed ? sarah stone : and i think , just to add to that around the impact of early trauma , i think one of the things that we at samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation . that sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being . we are social beings . and one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity , if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups , is to lead to lifelong isolation . it 's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men . you look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years , very often , and samaritans is about to release some research on that very point . so , there 's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here . there 's also , if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys , and we 're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men— . again , i think it 's important to see this whole picture— dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really in a position to answer fully as to what 's going on . i think that part of the problem is there 's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this , and i think that 's really why there 's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum . dawn bowden am : i appreciate you 're not educationalists and you would n't necessarily have all of that information , but have you got any sense of—again , whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you—evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems ? if you 've got any evidence of that , what might the impact of that be on the individuals ? you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? okay . thanks for that . can i just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances , and whether you 've come across any issues relating to welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue—that it 's not been available , welsh-medium support , for those learners ? have you come across that at all ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about the networking within the pru and the transition arrangements ? </s> nick williams : well , we 've just developed a behaviour and well-being strategy , which , with our schools—and i 'm aware , because i work in the south-west and mid wales region , and i know some of the other local authorities have something similar , and , similarly , i chair the eotas network across wales , and i know many local authorities are going in that direction , so that has a tiered approach , or staged approach , or whichever , so that there 's universal provision . i think it 's something that—you know , we need to make sure that our staff and our schools are well-equipped to meet these needs , but there will always , unfortunately , be some learners who need more specialist provision . so , it 's equipping them with those sorts of skills , really . i think it 's certainly moved forward from where we were two of three years ago . but there 's a little bit of lag in the system , trying to bring everybody up to the same , consistent level . but i think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities , as far as i 'm aware . sharon davies : i 'm not sure whether it 's being worse affected , but certainly there 's pressure , in particular with the new act coming in , and that 's going to place more pressure on the system . nick williams : the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . sian gwenllian am : okay . but just the pressures coming in with the new act et cetera could mean more expulsions . nick williams : well , again , i can only speak for ourselves . we 've had a big investment of time , and there will be money and through band b , we 're building a brand-new pru provision in swansea , which will be open in january 2021. so , we 've recognised that , so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools . there 's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school , and we continue to support them during that process . but then , when they 're back in school , that support does n't stop—that support continues , and then there 's a managed reduction in that support . and that 's proven very successful . david hopkins : i think , chair , at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting , but it 's early days yet for looking at that . i mean , that 's an ideal , obviously , but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully , and it brings— . the principle is fine , but it does bring a host of other issues with it , if you see what i mean . but it 's certainly a model worth looking at . it 's been tried elsewhere , and we keep an eye on that , but we do n't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that . sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . nick williams : sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . yes , but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use , in our experience . so , if it 's mtp or something through the college , like a mechanics course or something like that , we 're probably using it ourselves . so , it is quality assured , if you like , by two sides . janet finch-saunders am : what about if they 're in a private setting ? lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? you wo n't get any arguments from us on that . siân gwenllian has got some questions on the curriculum . david hopkins : in general terms— . you differentiate there between eotas and prus . prus : clearly , we know that they are following a set curriculum ; they are inspected ; they are under the control of the local authorities . so , we 're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there . where home tuition is provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , again , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . you ca n't always guarantee what then happens in the home . as you say , particular things happen there , and they may not get that . but that 's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle . it 's more difficult where , i suspect , it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned . the commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place ; it 's all about the monitoring then . but that 's a very general , broad-brush answer . i could n't give you a definitive one of what 's happening across wales . my colleagues can probably tell you what 's happening in their localities , and that would be helpful . but in general : prus , yes , we 'd be satisfied ; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority , yes , we would be satisfied ; other areas , we would not be able to give a definitive answer on , is my guess . sian gwenllian am : no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . david hopkins : if a child has additional needs , of course they should be met , whatever the setting . but i take your point . there 's a possibility that— . again , going back to the previous question , we would know within , say a pru or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition—whatever form that took—then those needs definitely should be being met . i ca n't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not—i don ’ t know—but they should be . once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system , then , again , if a child has a particular need , of course that need should be met , but it becomes increasingly difficult . so , i think there possibly is an issue there , but i do n't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that . but there certainly may well be an issue there . dawn bowden am : and on that point , actually , we did hear from estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision . there really is n't the capacity for them to access professional training . is that your experience ? and if so , what can we do about that ? sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . sian gwenllian am : yes . just to return to teacher training , and you say that new teachers ca n't go straight into a unit , and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect . but generally speaking , if there 's an increase in challenging behaviour , are new teachers able— ? they do n't have the experience , but are they equipped well enough to deal with that ? because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour , and again , i wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that . and we need—not just in this aspect—but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour . do you know what i 'm saying ? but if we 're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people , then it creates a great big challenge , does n't it ? we 're looking at something very limited here , but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what 's happening . would you agree with that ? dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . sarah stone : and , just finally , if that 's okay , just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy , to which we made extensive representations on this issue . a part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools . so , that is a commitment in that strategy . it 's a really important commitment to make a reality of that , because , actually , what is happening , i think , is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think it 's an issue where it 's very important both to focus on the individual , but also on the macro situation , and , as sarah mentioned , i think the whole-school approach , which is something that 's been discussed within this committee , as part of the 'mind over matter ' work , is something that is hugely important . and that 's why that should be—there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach . because understanding— . that prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will , hopefully , be very effective in providing support levels , ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning , all the way through primary school , all the way through secondary school , to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that 's at the forefront of people 's considerations whenever they 're considering what a pupil is doing , and why they might be doing it . and that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences . but , generally , just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first , i think , is hugely important in this context . sarah stone : so , this is where we set out nine recommendations in our report and i think the major message is , as i said before , that we do n't have a simple answer to this one . however , there are a number of things that we need to do : we need to recognise the impact of adverse childhood experiences ; we need to train teachers so that they have an understanding response and are much more confident in that ; we need to learn from what works ; we need to listen to the voices of young people themselves . that 's terribly important , because— . i know this committee is very well aware of that , because you 've done very good work listening to the direct voices of young people , but they are very often able to articulate quite a lot about what is needed . i would also add to that that we would want young people themselves to be skilled up in understanding and recognising their own emotions , because this is about putting in place that awareness , that consciousness , if you like , about being able to name and recognise feelings . there 's great international evidence on the importance of that and the benefit of it , which was carried out when the new curriculum was being developed , and the health aspect of that . so , we 've kind of done that work in wales . what we would like to see is that new curriculum around health and well-being and mental health and awareness being in the curriculum , so that young people , on a statutory basis— . otherwise , you 're entrenching the differences and the inequalities between teaching across wales , because the good will do it , and perhaps others will find it much harder . so , that 's a major message as well . so , i think there 's a menu , if you like , and some of it is very much about respecting the experience of teachers and of schools and working with them , because this is about working with their will to do things well . dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . i do n't think we 're really in a position to answer fully as to what 's going on . i think that part of the problem is there 's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this , and i think that 's really why there 's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum . dawn bowden am : sure . so much of your evidence is anecdotal , is it ? it 's people that have been referred to you , come to you for help , and you just—or your own research . what— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . dawn bowden am : i guess the eotas or pru provision is going to be much more challenging then , is n't it , then main school provision . i suppose that was what i was trying to get at as well , whether you get a sense that there may be some progress being made in mainstream schools , is that following through in prus and eotas provision ? dr ian johnson : i 'll just be honest : right now , i could n't give you an answer on that . i think that is something that , perhaps , slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues . i would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice . i 've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally , but i think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it 's done . we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . and as ian just said , although there 's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority , i suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well . but for the parents to support their child , either if they 're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in eotas , and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible , the parent has to have the right amount of information . they must know where to go for support themselves , and i think that a parent ca n't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they 're not provided with all of the information . and i 'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority , but that 's something worth thinking about as well . </s>
<s> what was the major challenge of the transition of the excluded students ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . lynne neagle am : okay . anybody got anything to add to that , or— ? sharon davies : i would say the majority have . a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet . janet finch-saunders am : what ? sorry , i missed that . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? david hopkins : in general terms— . you differentiate there between eotas and prus . prus : clearly , we know that they are following a set curriculum ; they are inspected ; they are under the control of the local authorities . so , we 're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there . where home tuition is provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , again , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . you ca n't always guarantee what then happens in the home . as you say , particular things happen there , and they may not get that . but that 's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle . it 's more difficult where , i suspect , it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned . the commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place ; it 's all about the monitoring then . but that 's a very general , broad-brush answer . i could n't give you a definitive one of what 's happening across wales . my colleagues can probably tell you what 's happening in their localities , and that would be helpful . but in general : prus , yes , we 'd be satisfied ; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority , yes , we would be satisfied ; other areas , we would not be able to give a definitive answer on , is my guess . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . sarah stone : i think you were going to— . dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to

i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . liz williams : i think there 's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable . so , i suppose , if you consider that , this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there 's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps are n't attaining brilliant grades . so , i think that 's something that needs to be looked at further . sarah stone : and , just finally , if that 's okay , just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy , to which we made extensive representations on this issue . a part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools . so , that is a commitment in that strategy . it 's a really important commitment to make a reality of that , because , actually , what is happening , i think , is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . lynne neagle am : thank you . dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . janet finch-saunders am : thank you so much . very good . thank you . lynne neagle am : thank you . dawn . dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . i 'll just be honest : right now , i could n't give you an answer on that . i think that is something that , perhaps , slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues . i would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice . i 've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally , but i think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it 's done . dawn bowden am : you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? liz williams : absolutely , yes , and i think that 's where formal diagnosis can be helpful . i think the doors are open then to much more school support . so , yes , i think it is down to how the school approach it , and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum . it embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school , and it means that students might know when they need help , how to be more resilient and helping themselves , and when and how to ask for help from the teachers . so , i think it 's really important . dawn bowden am : okay . thanks for that . can i just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances , and whether you 've come across any issues relating to welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue—that it 's not been available , welsh-medium support , for those learners ? have you come across that at all ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . dr ian johnson : the truth is , the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context , i would say . the point is that , often , these children deal with several other institutions . so , it 's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation . more information is needed about this . when i was talking earlier about inclusive education , or some kind of investigation into this , that 's the kind of thing i 'd look at : how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available . i 'm concerned , of course , in terms of education , whether there is enough funding available to ensure this . but because this is a very vulnerable group , we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way , perhaps , as corporate parenting plays a role there . we need to look at that kind of system , and how we help these individuals . i know there are figures available on local authorities , but i ca n't remember them off the top of my head , but maybe that 's something to look at . </s>
<s> what was the solution to the major challenge for the transition of the excluded students ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . sharon davies : i would say the majority have . nick williams : the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . well , again , i can only speak for ourselves . we 've had a big investment of time , and there will be money and through band b , we 're building a brand-new pru provision in swansea , which will be open in january 2021. so , we 've recognised that , so that we have our staff working very closely with the schools . there 's an integration through a part-time timetable back into school , and we continue to support them during that process . but then , when they 're back in school , that support does n't stop—that support continues , and then there 's a managed reduction in that support . and that 's proven very successful . lynne neagle am : oh , okay . and where is it being tried elsewhere ? in england , is it ? sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . nick williams : sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? nick williams : it 's about getting that money following the learner and so on , and that shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep , because we want them reintegrated back into schools—that 's the aim of any provision that we put in . it 's not permanent—except , for certain learners , that might be the case—so they 're still , if you like , part and parcel of the school . i think one of your other colleagues asked about the off-rolling , if you like—another term that 's used—of students when they get to gcses so they do n't count in schools ' data . we 're trying to very much move away from that , through the messages that we all give our schools . the messages that governors and headteachers then give to their staff . so : 'they 're our learners . they 're the most vulnerable learners we 've got . ' and for the individuals , for the families , and for society , if we ca n't support these learners—we know the links then to crime , and the cost to us as a society as well . so , it 's in all our interests to do the very best for these learners . david hopkins : in general terms— . you differentiate there between eotas and prus . prus : clearly , we know that they are following a set curriculum ; they are inspected ; they are under the control of the local authorities . so , we 're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there . where home tuition is provided through the local authority , as has been discussed , again , there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving . you ca n't always guarantee what then happens in the home . as you say , particular things happen there , and they may not get that . but that 's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle . it 's more difficult where , i suspect , it 's being provided by a third party that 's been commissioned . the commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place ; it 's all about the monitoring then . but that 's a very general , broad-brush answer . i could n't give you a definitive one of what 's happening across wales . my colleagues can probably tell you what 's happening in their localities , and that would be helpful . but in general : prus , yes , we 'd be satisfied ; home tuition that is commissioned and managed through the local authority , yes , we would be satisfied ; other areas , we would not be able to give a definitive answer on , is my guess . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . dawn bowden am : and on that point , actually , we did hear from estyn the point you were making about the staff leaving and there are very small numbers of staff working in that provision . there really is n't the capacity for them to access professional training . is that your experience ? and if so , what can we do about that ? lynne neagle am : thank you . janet , i think some of the areas have been covered . is there anything you want to pick up from the— ? janet finch-saunders am : oh , sorry , i thought you meant north wales . sorry . sarah stone : i think you were going to— . dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . sarah stone : and , just finally , if that 's okay , just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy , to which we made extensive representations on this issue . a part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools . so , that is a commitment in that strategy . it 's a really important commitment to make a reality of that , because , actually , what is happening , i think , is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders around the support for learners who are at risk of becoming eotas . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by

headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that

we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think

on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . dawn bowden am : you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? okay . thanks for that . can i just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances , and whether you 've come across any issues relating to welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue—that it 's not been available , welsh-medium support , for those learners ? have you come across that at all ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . dr ian johnson : the truth is , the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context , i would say . the point is that , often , these children deal with several other institutions . so , it 's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation . more information is needed about this . when i was talking earlier about inclusive education , or some kind of investigation into this , that 's the kind of thing i 'd look at : how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available . i 'm concerned , of course , in terms of education , whether there is enough funding available to ensure this . but because this is a very vulnerable group , we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way , perhaps , as corporate parenting plays a role there . we need to look at that kind of system , and how we help these individuals . i know there are figures available on local authorities , but i ca n't remember them off the top of my head , but maybe that 's something to look at . </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about the pros and cons of local authoritative frameworks ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . certainly with schools , i know across wales we 've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice , so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through , whereas in the past—i 'm thinking myself , now , as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours . i did n't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through . so , i think we are more informed as a profession . the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . sian gwenllian am : okay . but just the pressures coming in with the new act et cetera could mean more expulsions . sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . nick williams : sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . yes , but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use , in our experience . so , if it 's mtp or something through the college , like a mechanics course or something like that , we 're probably using it ourselves . so , it is quality assured , if you like , by two sides . janet finch-saunders am : well , i appreciate that , and that 's the— [ inaudible . ] what about if they 're in a private setting ? lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? david hopkins : of course it 's a concern . if you ca n't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person , it is a concern . sian gwenllian am : yes . i can see how collaborative working with the units can work—because they 're under your control—the problem is the other parts of the system , in a way . no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . it 's really around support . it follows on a little bit from what siân was saying . can i also just refer back to the point that david was making earlier on about aln and the extent to which aln support is available to learners in eotas ? the information that we 've had is that it 's difficult enough in mainstream schools , but in an eotas setting , it 's particularly challenging . so , how can that be improved ? what can we do to address that ? the reason i 'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an eotas setting—that 's why they 're there , quite often . so , it 's almost more important that that aln provision follows them through . david hopkins : if a child has additional needs , of course they should be met , whatever the setting . but i take your point . there 's a possibility that— . again , going back to the previous question , we would know within , say a pru or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition—whatever form that took—then those needs definitely should be being met . i ca n't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not—i don ’ t know—but they should be . once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system , then , again , if a child has a particular need , of course that need should be met , but it becomes increasingly difficult . so , i think there possibly is an issue there , but i do n't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that . but there certainly may well be an issue there . dawn bowden am : there is a disconnect between what should be happening and what actually is happening , is n't there ? even in some local authority prus where we expect all of this to be happening , we know that it ’ s not ; we know that the full curriculum is not being provided either . the basic numeracy , literacy and well-being stuff is taking place , but there is discrepancy of provision , even in local authority commissioned eotas provision . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . dawn bowden am : i understand that . no . but you 're saying , really , take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting . i understand that . sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . sian gwenllian am : but if we 're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people , then it creates a great big challenge , does n't it ? we 're looking at something very limited here , but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what 's happening . would you agree with that ? lynne neagle am : thank you . janet , i think some of the areas have been covered . is there anything you want to pick up from the— ? janet finch-saunders am : yes , i think the rural aspect—are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for eotas learners , particularly in more rural parts or areas of wales ? dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think it 's an issue where it 's very important both to focus on the individual , but also on the macro situation , and , as sarah mentioned , i think the whole-school approach , which is something that 's been discussed within this committee , as part of the 'mind over matter ' work , is something that is hugely important . and that 's why that should be—there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach . because understanding— . that prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will , hopefully , be very effective in providing support levels , ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning , all the way through primary school , all the way through secondary school , to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that 's at the forefront of people 's considerations whenever they 're considering what a pupil is doing , and why they might be doing it . and that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences . but , generally , just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first , i think , is hugely important in this context . i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really in a position to answer fully as to what 's going on . i think that part of the problem is there 's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this , and i think that 's really why there 's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum . dawn bowden am : sure . so much of your evidence is anecdotal , is it ? it 's people that have been referred to you , come to you for help , and you just—or your own research . what— ? you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? </s>
<s> what did sharon davies think of the role that local authorities should take in the quality assurance of individual intuition ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . lynne neagle am : okay . in terms of parents , what are local authorities doing to actually engage parents of children and young people who are either eotas or at risk of becoming eotas ? and do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across wales ? nick williams : certainly with schools , i know across wales we 've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice , so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through , whereas in the past—i 'm thinking myself , now , as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours . i did n't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through . so , i think we are more informed as a profession . sian gwenllian am : okay . but just the pressures coming in with the new act et cetera could mean more expulsions . and is the fact that there 's variation from term to term , from week to week sometimes , in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge , and maybe that that leads to more exclusions ? lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders . janet finch-saunders am : yes . thank you . in your view— lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . so , in your view , though , what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing eotas provision ? nick williams : capacity— obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . i can only speak for swansea . we know , as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in , they have to put down where that provision is . and obviously , as part of the visits , as well , to the schools by the challenge advisers , the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision . the schools would have to make sure that— janet finch-saunders am : what about if they 're in a private setting ? lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? david hopkins : of course it 's a concern . if you ca n't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person , it is a concern . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . i think it 's limited . i think it is getting better , as nick mentioned . there are networks now , there are conferences . it is an improving picture , but i think it 's limited . dawn bowden am : yes , okay . so , is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of eotas ? no . but you 're saying , really , take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting . i understand that . okay . can i just take you back to pupil support ? we talked about aln . what about access to mental health services ? what 's your experience of eotas learners ' access to mental health support ? yes , of course . but is your experience also that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could potentially be leading to more learners ending up in an eotas provision . lynne neagle am : siân , you had a supplementary . nick williams : it 's not just— . if people decide not to go into teaching after having training , it 's not just because of challenging behaviour . there is a change now . there is more time for students in schools , so that helps . you need the theory , but also the practice—that 's important to have somebody who can mentor you in the school and that shows good practice . then there are the policies that the school uses to assure that there is consistency across the whole school . sian gwenllian am : but if we 're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people , then it creates a great big challenge , does n't it ? we 're looking at something very limited here , but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what 's happening . would you agree with that ? lynne neagle am : thank you . janet , i think some of the areas have been covered . is there anything you want to pick up from the— ? janet finch-saunders am : yes , i think the rural aspect—are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for eotas learners , particularly in more rural parts or areas of wales ? nick williams : sorry . but even so , the distances that those learners are having to travel are huge . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? </s>
<s> summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the intuition in a private setting . </s> lynne neagle am : okay . in terms of parents , what are local authorities doing to actually engage parents of children and young people who are either eotas or at risk of becoming eotas ? and do you think that all local authorities have got that understanding across wales ? nick williams : certainly with schools , i know across wales we 've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice , so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through , whereas in the past—i 'm thinking myself , now , as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours . i did n't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through . so , i think we are more informed as a profession . david hopkins : it should n't , but it could . it 's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react . if they 're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures , they will react in a particular way . culturally , we 've got to get to the point , i think , particularly with the new curriculum coming in , where we say , 'look , forget the narrow measures that you 're being judged by . we 're trying to agree with partners , including estyn and the welsh government , a broader range of measures . ' that , in a sense , may provide opportunities for schools , and local authorities , to look more constructively at this whole area . so , that 's one area , but you 're right , i think the aln legislation will put pressures on , not just local authorities and schools , but also on the post-16 sector , because we 're talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well . so , we 've got a host of issues , i think , there to consider and work our way through . sian gwenllian am : and is the fact that there 's variation from term to term , from week to week sometimes , in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge , and maybe that that leads to more exclusions ? sharon davies : as nick said , it does get more difficult at key stage 4 , and it 's working , then , with— . it comes back to that team-around-the-family approach , to ensure what is needed for that learner to go back into school , what can the school provide . it 's looking at the whole package of support , then , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it 's transport—it 's looking at the whole agenda , then , to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school , where it 's possible . david hopkins : i think , chair , at least one authority is looking at how they can best retain all pupils in the school setting , but it 's early days yet for looking at that . i mean , that 's an ideal , obviously , but it does mean looking at your funding constructively and carefully , and it brings— . the principle is fine , but it does bring a host of other issues with it , if you see what i mean . but it 's certainly a model worth looking at . it 's been tried elsewhere , and we keep an eye on that , but we do n't really know what the outcomes have been long term with that . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . so , in your view , though , what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing eotas provision ? nick williams : capacity— sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . obviously , we do do that , but we 're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding . however , we do n't want to make it too difficult , so that we have n't got any providers coming forward either . so , it 's a little bit of a balancing act . but , first and foremost , safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking . but i think , then , we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have . at the moment , that is a struggle for us , because we 're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is— . but , to actually offer some additional training is a challenge . janet finch-saunders am : okay , thank you . to what extent do local authorities know about the level of eotas provision that is organised by individual schools , whether in an fe college or otherwise off the school site ? what about if they 're in a private setting ? david hopkins : and that 's more difficult to answer , i suspect . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? nick williams : i think it 's , you know— sian gwenllian am : yes . i just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands , and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum , of course . what are the challenges ? i 'll begin with the wlga , in general , and ask you , in both your areas , what are the challenges to ensure that eotas learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum , and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them ? what are the challenges associated with that ? nick williams : to be honest , they are broad and balanced . they have to be broad and balanced currently . but there 's working together now in terms of the new curriculum , and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well . sian gwenllian am : no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . david hopkins : if a child has additional needs , of course they should be met , whatever the setting . but i take your point . there 's a possibility that— . again , going back to the previous question , we would know within , say a pru or any local authority commissioned or delivered tuition—whatever form that took—then those needs definitely should be being met . i ca n't tell you hand on heart whether they all are or not—i don ’ t know—but they should be . once you get out of that very tightly regulated part of the system , then , again , if a child has a particular need , of course that need should be met , but it becomes increasingly difficult . so , i think there possibly is an issue there , but i do n't know whether my colleagues have a greater understanding of that . but there certainly may well be an issue there . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . i think it 's limited . i think it is getting better , as nick mentioned . there are networks now , there are conferences . it is an improving picture , but i think it 's limited . dawn bowden am : yes , okay . so , is there any way that local authorities can encourage specialist teachers and educational psychologists to actually share expertise with independent providers of eotas ? nick williams : yes , but again , it 's a capacity issue , because if we take them out of the provision , it 's difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands . so , it 's not an easy conundrum . dawn bowden am : no . but you 're saying , really , take it back to teacher training and start at that point so that every teacher has at least some basic awareness of dealing with education in that setting . i understand that . sharon davies : or whether there 's an opportunity , if somebody wants to lead into that more , that there 's an opportunity to do it ; that there 's an offer there , if they want to specialise more into that area . but at the minute , there is n't that option . dawn bowden am : yes , of course . but is your experience also that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could potentially be leading to more learners ending up in an eotas provision . david hopkins : i was going to say , about the question , i think there 's a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services , for example . i 'm not criticising the services , i 'm just saying the capacity is n't there , as we would like . so , i think there 's probably a more general issue there that would , in turn , translate into pupils who 've got additional needs , whether they 're in eotas , pru or wherever . i suspect—i 've not got an evidence base to offer you , but there 's a very long-standing problem there . sian gwenllian am : but if we 're facing a situation where there are fewer wanting to go into the profession and we are losing those most experienced people , then it creates a great big challenge , does n't it ? we 're looking at something very limited here , but we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what 's happening . would you agree with that ? janet finch-saunders am : yes , i think the rural aspect—are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for eotas learners , particularly in more rural parts or areas of wales ? nick williams : sorry . but even so , the distances that those learners are having to travel are huge . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? i appreciate you 're not educationalists and you would n't necessarily have all of that information , but have you got any sense of—again , whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you—evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems ? if you 've got any evidence of that , what might the impact of that be on the individuals ? okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about issues on the special education and recruitment of professional staff ? </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . sharon davies : i think it 's early to say , but certainly we 're working towards that improvement . i can only speak for torfaen—we 've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced , and accounts for every learner within the system . nick williams : the messages that the government is conveying to us and the messages we convey as directors and councils are important as well . so , we always tell them that it 's the progression of the children in the future that 's important , not just reaching up to the level . so , it 's more complex than that , and it 's important to share that . and in fairness to estyn—estyn has changed its mind as well . so , messages such as those are being conveyed now , and i think that the schools do understand now the expectation and what 's expected of them . sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school .

lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? sian gwenllian am : yes . i just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands , and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum , of course . what are the challenges ? i 'll begin with the wlga , in general , and ask you , in both your areas , what are the challenges to ensure that eotas learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum , and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them ? what are the challenges associated with that ? in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . it 's really around support . it follows on a little bit from what siân was saying . can i also just refer back to the point that david was making earlier on about aln and the extent to which aln support is available to learners in eotas ? the information that we 've had is that it 's difficult enough in mainstream schools , but in an eotas setting , it 's particularly challenging . so , how can that be improved ? what can we do to address that ? the reason i 'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an eotas setting—that 's why they 're there , quite often . so , it 's almost more important that that aln provision follows them through . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . absolutely . it 's more than just one person—it 's the whole training package that goes around that capacity as well . sian gwenllian am : yes . just to return to teacher training , and you say that new teachers ca n't go straight into a unit , and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect . but generally speaking , if there 's an increase in challenging behaviour , are new teachers able— ? they do n't have the experience , but are they equipped well enough to deal with that ? because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour , and again , i wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that . and we need—not just in this aspect—but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour . do you know what i 'm saying ? dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . liz williams : i think there 's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable . so , i suppose , if you consider that , this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there 's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps are n't attaining brilliant grades . so , i think that 's something that needs to be looked at further . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think it 's an issue where it 's very important both to focus on the individual , but also on the macro situation , and , as sarah mentioned , i think the whole-school approach , which is something that 's been discussed within this committee , as part of the 'mind over matter ' work , is something that is hugely important . and that 's why that should be—there should be statutory provision regarding a whole-school approach . because understanding— . that prevention operating all the way through the whole-school community will , hopefully , be very effective in providing support levels , ensuring that that support is in place from the very beginning , all the way through primary school , all the way through secondary school , to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that 's at the forefront of people 's considerations whenever they 're considering what a pupil is doing , and why they might be doing it . and that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences . but , generally , just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first , i think , is hugely important in this context . i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . liz williams : i think it 's a really difficult balance , but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report . so , we held a round table during the research period , and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs . and , obviously , this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups . and they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp , or not properly diagnosed , and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and , again , these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded . so , when you consider that , you tend to think , actually , diagnosis could be really useful , so that staff are aware of the pupil 's needs , and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour . however , what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child 's condition or additional learning needs , and that the proper support was there , then diagnosis alone was n't of value . so , i think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need , so , again , if the support is n't there , that child is n't going to benefit from diagnosis . and what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive , and for that child , regardless of whether they had an additional learning need or not , to have proper opportunity to progress . dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? sure . so much of your evidence is anecdotal , is it ? it 's people that have been referred to you , come to you for help , and you just—or your own research . what— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . i 'll just be honest : right now , i could n't give you an answer on that . i think that is something that , perhaps , slightly concerns me about the whole field is not being able to get a national feel for these issues . i would suspect that there are pockets of very good practice . i 've heard discussions about things being done regionally and nationally , but i think it would be good to be able to see what that best practice looks like and how well it 's done . dawn bowden am : i appreciate you 're not educationalists and you would n't necessarily have all of that information , but have you got any sense of—again , whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you—evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems ? if you 've got any evidence of that , what might the impact of that be on the individuals ? you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? liz williams : absolutely , yes , and i think that 's where formal diagnosis can be helpful . i think the doors are open then to much more school support . so , yes , i think it is down to how the school approach it , and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum . it embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school , and it means that students might know when they need help , how to be more resilient and helping themselves , and when and how to ask for help from the teachers . so , i think it 's really important . dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . and as ian just said , although there 's a lot of responsibility by the school and the local authority , i suppose some responsibility also sits with the parent as well . but for the parents to support their child , either if they 're at risk of being excluded or if the child is already in eotas , and that parent wants to make sure that the child is having the best education possible , the parent has to have the right amount of information . they must know where to go for support themselves , and i think that a parent ca n't necessarily know the rights of their child to education and what their child is supposed to be having if they 're not provided with all of the information . and i 'm sure this is dependent on the school or dependent on the local authority , but that 's something worth thinking about as well . </s>
<s> what was the major challenge of training professional staff for special education ? </s> sharon davies : i think it 's early to say , but certainly we 're working towards that improvement . i can only speak for torfaen—we 've been working really hard on our exclusions and working with our schools to ensure that the curriculum is broad and balanced , and accounts for every learner within the system . nick williams : certainly with schools , i know across wales we 've done a lot of training on adverse childhood experiences and trauma-informed practice , so at least people can perhaps better understand some of the reasons why this behaviour is coming through , whereas in the past—i 'm thinking myself , now , as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours . i did n't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through . so , i think we are more informed as a profession . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . so , in your view , though , what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing eotas provision ? lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? nick williams : i think it 's , you know— david hopkins : of course it 's a concern . if you ca n't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person , it is a concern . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? no , it 's beyond the prus i 'm talking about . if a pupil is in a pru , you are telling me that they have the curriculum . but for those who are in homes , or in private provision , perhaps who are not in your experience— . maybe , this morning , we 're getting a picture of the best practice , and we 're not going under the surface to where things are n't as good in some areas . do you agree that there is that inconsistency ? what we 're hearing about now are the best elements . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . it 's really around support . it follows on a little bit from what siân was saying . can i also just refer back to the point that david was making earlier on about aln and the extent to which aln support is available to learners in eotas ? the information that we 've had is that it 's difficult enough in mainstream schools , but in an eotas setting , it 's particularly challenging . so , how can that be improved ? what can we do to address that ? the reason i 'm saying that is there are particular needs of learners in an eotas setting—that 's why they 're there , quite often . so , it 's almost more important that that aln provision follows them through . sharon davies : it 's kind of what nick said about capacity , but it 's also ensuring the right staff as well , because sometimes , you may have them , but if they move on , or retire , or whatever , there 's not a bus load , if you like , of people with that expertise . because sometimes it takes years to build up on that expertise , and therefore , it 's quite niche , and once that person has moved on , it 's really difficult to start all over again . sian gwenllian am : yes . just to return to teacher training , and you say that new teachers ca n't go straight into a unit , and maybe more emphasis is needed on that aspect . but generally speaking , if there 's an increase in challenging behaviour , are new teachers able— ? they do n't have the experience , but are they equipped well enough to deal with that ? because we hear of so many people leaving the profession because of this challenging behaviour , and again , i wonder if the system has adequately caught up with that . and we need—not just in this aspect—but we need to look at the system holistically to be more prepared to deal with challenging behaviour . do you know what i 'm saying ? nick williams : it 's not just— . if people decide not to go into teaching after having training , it 's not just because of challenging behaviour . there is a change now . there is more time for students in schools , so that helps . you need the theory , but also the practice—that 's important to have somebody who can mentor you in the school and that shows good practice . then there are the policies that the school uses to assure that there is consistency across the whole school . sarah stone : i think you were going to— . dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . liz williams : i think there 's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable . so , i suppose , if you consider that , this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there 's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps are n't attaining brilliant grades . so , i think that 's something that needs to be looked at further . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . liz williams : i think it 's a really difficult balance , but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report . so , we held a round table during the research period , and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs . and , obviously , this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups . and they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp , or not properly diagnosed , and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and , again , these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded . so , when you consider that , you tend to think , actually , diagnosis could be really useful , so that staff are aware of the pupil 's needs , and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour . however , what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child 's condition or additional learning needs , and that the proper support was there , then diagnosis alone was n't of value . so , i think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need , so , again , if the support is n't there , that child is n't going to benefit from diagnosis . and what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive , and for that child , regardless of whether they had an additional learning need or not , to have proper opportunity to progress . dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . sarah stone : and i think , just to add to that around the impact of early trauma , i think one of the things that we at samaritans are particularly aware of is the impact of loneliness and isolation on individuals and how that can help to drive distress and suicidal ideation . that sense of belongingness is recognised by the research as being critical to functioning well as a human being . we are social beings . and one of the ways in which early trauma and adversity , if that leads to exclusion from a range of groups , is to lead to lifelong isolation . it 's something that comes out when you look at middle-aged men . you look at a trajectory that goes back towards their early years , very often , and samaritans is about to release some research on that very point . so , there 's a connection between what happens in later life and what happens here . there 's also , if we look at the numbers of exclusions around boys , and we 're looking at much higher suicide rates and numbers of other issues around men— . again , i think it 's important to see this whole picture— dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? sure . so much of your evidence is anecdotal , is it ? it 's people that have been referred to you , come to you for help , and you just—or your own research . what— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . dawn bowden am : i appreciate you 're not educationalists and you would n't necessarily have all of that information , but have you got any sense of—again , whether this is anecdotal or from cases that are referred to you—evidence of schools off-rolling pupils with mental health problems ? if you 've got any evidence of that , what might the impact of that be on the individuals ? you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? liz williams : absolutely , yes . i think it 's really down to the school . i think it 's down to experience and it 's down to the teacher . i think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support . lots of children with communication difficulties especially , if they have n't been formally diagnosed , they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty , because i suppose people think , 'well , you should be doing well , you 're bright . you should be thriving in school . ' but that 's not always the case . children can be incredibly anxious , have mental health problems , obviously , are exposed to aces and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about . so , i think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty ' , and i think children also play up to that as well . like i said , if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom , if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space , they will do that . absolutely , yes , and i think that 's where formal diagnosis can be helpful . i think the doors are open then to much more school support . so , yes , i think it is down to how the school approach it , and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum . it embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school , and it means that students might know when they need help , how to be more resilient and helping themselves , and when and how to ask for help from the teachers . so , i think it 's really important . dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . dr ian johnson : the truth is , the responsibility lies on the local education authority in that context , i would say . the point is that , often , these children deal with several other institutions . so , it 's incredibly important that any service is interweaved into that setting around the child or the children who are in this situation . more information is needed about this . when i was talking earlier about inclusive education , or some kind of investigation into this , that 's the kind of thing i 'd look at : how to bridge that gap and what kind of support will be available . i 'm concerned , of course , in terms of education , whether there is enough funding available to ensure this . but because this is a very vulnerable group , we need to take responsibility in exactly the same way , perhaps , as corporate parenting plays a role there . we need to look at that kind of system , and how we help these individuals . i know there are figures available on local authorities , but i ca n't remember them off the top of my head , but maybe that 's something to look at . </s>
<s> summarize the conclusion of the discussion about the transport for eotas learners in rural areas . </s> nick williams : i 'll start , if that 's okay . i think one of the things we 're experiencing across the system in wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour . i think the prevalence of asd—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge . obviously , i can speak more about my own local authority in swansea : the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five , six years , so what 's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well , and the system 's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that , so that is placing pressure on schools and then , in turn , pressure on the eotas , including our pupil referral units , because , obviously , we just probably have n't got enough capacity at the moment in the system . the same , really . but just sometimes , the government does n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because we 've gone back to the government to tell them , 'right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in the school sector ? ' and in fairness , they have addressed that , but perhaps it 's not at the forefront of their minds when they 're thinking of providing funding to the schools . so , it 's a little bit of an afterthought . but this will be needed in the future , certainly . sian gwenllian am : and is the fact that there 's variation from term to term , from week to week sometimes , in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge , and maybe that that leads to more exclusions ? lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders . sharon davies : a few years ago , i used to be a primary headteacher in england , so we were looking at different models , then , at various conferences , and i believe oxford , as a local authority—they had a pru , and they had discussions with their secondary schools , then , whether to get rid of the pru , as such , and give the money back into schools . but they looked at a partnership within the schools , then , to say , 'okay , you can have the money , but there 's got to be terms of reference'—not quite a service level agreement , but the schools worked together as a partnership , then , so that they could n't keep moving the children around , the learners around . it 's looking at how well that worked . it started off really well , but that was a few years ago , so i do n't know whether it 's continued now . but that was a model that , at the time , that local authority looked at to get more money into schools and to get schools , then , to have that responsibility—that they did n't offload the learners elsewhere . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet . janet finch-saunders am : what ? sorry , i missed that . nick williams : sorry . capacity : we just have n't got enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . obviously , given what i 've said as well , and i 'm sure it 'd be the same for all local authorities , we 've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision , if you like , the home school . so , there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable , which is n't ideal , i accept , but again , it 's working with the families and the youngsters . also , for us as well we 've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion . we have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners . sometimes , it works really well ; sometimes , the learner turns around and says , 'actually , i preferred it in my old school . ' so , there 's a cooling-off period as well . i think the learner voice is very important there , because— . we 've got to have a package , i think , that is quite wide in its offer . lynne neagle am : what we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority , but i think nick has answered that now , really , if that 's a consistent answer for local authorities . can i just ask , before we move on , in the wlga paper , you say you 're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are eotas and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working ' . can you expand on those concerns for the committee ? sian gwenllian am : yes . i just want to discuss a little about the curriculum as it stands , and thinking about transferring to a new curriculum , of course . what are the challenges ? i 'll begin with the wlga , in general , and ask you , in both your areas , what are the challenges to ensure that eotas learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum , and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them ? what are the challenges associated with that ? david hopkins : of course it 's a concern . if you ca n't guarantee quality in any shape or form for a young person , it is a concern . sian gwenllian am : in terms of the how curriculum is at present , are you happy that it 's being delivered ? lynne neagle am : siân , you had a supplementary . thank you . janet , i think some of the areas have been covered . is there anything you want to pick up from the— ? nick williams : sorry . but even so , the distances that those learners are having to travel are huge . dr ian johnson : i think it 's a very difficult subject , because , in many cases , we 're not really sure what the data looks like . we get these things from quite a broad perspective , and we do n't actually see the extent of the reasons why . if you look at , for example , the statistical release , then you get a sense of why people are being excluded , but they tend to be— . it 's a very reductionist discussion , so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour , verbal abuse or physical assaults , but you do n't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that . now , we know that that information exists , because , obviously , schools do n't exclude anybody lightly , and i speak as someone who 's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools . so , there 's a great deal of paper trail , but that does n't seem to really find its way up to a higher level . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . and how concerned are you about the trend that we 're seeing of an increase in younger children being excluded , and what do you think the reasons might be for that ? dr ian johnson : i think it 's very concerning that we 're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular . those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years , and a lot of the evidence that we 're hearing is quite anecdotal , so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues , and there 's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's— . so , there 's a better understanding of that , but i 'm not in a position at the moment , really , to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to . lynne neagle am : okay . you may not be able to answer this , but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions ? dr ian johnson : well , i think it 's very interesting , looking at estyn 's pupil registration practices report from october last year , which looks at off-rolling , and i think that you see , specifically at year 10 to 11 , a strong impact : around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11 , but you 're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9 , year 9/year 10. so , i think it 's clear that there 's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11 , but what i think is concerning for me is the normalisation , throughout the system , at secondary school level , where there 's off-rolling between year 7/8 , year 8/9 . based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort , then you 're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year , and i think we need to understand why that is the norm , what could be done around that , as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11. the estyn work is quite factual . it 's looking at the numbers . i think we need to dig a bit deeper and understand the story behind that and whether there 's a specific reason why schools are doing that , related to the accountability measures . it 'll be interesting to see the impact of changes towards capped 9 et cetera , but i think we need a bit more qualitative work on that rather than just the quantitative work that 's currently available . liz williams : i think there 's also a problem with schools only being measured on academic outcomes rather than the journey travelled by the child and the efforts put in by the school to nurture the well-being of children who are particularly vulnerable . so , i suppose , if you consider that , this is something that definitely needs to be looked at further so that there 's incentive for schools to keep children who are perhaps demonstrating challenging behaviour or perhaps are n't attaining brilliant grades . so , i think that 's something that needs to be looked at further . dr ian johnson : could i just come in on that ? i think there 's an interesting , again , qualitative , quantitative , element to what happens to those children who move into pru , eotas provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career . so , i think there 's a question , then , about—i was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8 , 8/9 , et cetera , and how they loop back into the mainstream education system , what happens to them , but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into eotas , pru provision , and what happens to those young people afterwards ? i 'm sure we 'll pick up some of that as we go through . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you . we 've got some questions now from janet finch-saunders around the support for learners who are at risk of becoming eotas . janet finch-saunders am : good morning . to what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming eotas ? sarah stone : okay . so , this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did , and we came up with a range of suggestions . i think the quick answer is that what we 've seen is a strong indication that it is n't , and that it's— . but also that it 's not simply a question of the young person , that it 's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing . so , there are a couple of big things to say on this one . one is that we want to promote a compassionate response and an informed response by everybody in the school to distressed young people—and that distress may show in a number of ways , not necessarily just as obvious distress . so , i think it 's understanding that , having a confident response and , obviously , this links with expressing suicidal thoughts and distress as well , which may not come out in exactly that way—but being able to respond where young people are expressing suicidal thoughts . and i think if we connect this with the agenda around adverse childhood experiences , and if you see the young person— . i think what we as samaritans really wanted to do was to focus on the distressed individual—that 's what we do , it 's what we 're majorly about . so , a young person who is experiencing a whole range of adversity in their own life may be presenting at school in a very challenging way , perhaps . that school may also be their only safe place , and i think that 's just a really simple thing just to keep remembering . hearing headteachers and teachers talk about this , a lot of them are very aware of that , and there are some great examples of schools working to reduce exclusions and understanding the fork in the road that exclusion or not exclusion represents in the life of that young person . there are restorative justice-type approaches being used by schools in cardiff that seem extraordinarily inspiring . i 've heard— . there 's been so much interest in this piece of work that we 've done , and i 've spoken to many educators since , and so it 's doing what we needed to do , which is to get people talking about it . because i think it 's not about providing a simplistic answer to this question of support , it is understanding that it 's a whole-school question . it 's building on the excellent work that is being done by schools in different parts of wales , joining that up and making that much more general . so , i think that 's the opportunity : is to really recognise that this is a big issue , and that , if you do n't hold young people within an educational setting , the lifetime consequences for them , including their elevated risk of suicide—it 's very hard to reverse that . so , i think we want to focus on a distressed young person and how we respond to that , and it 's amazing to move someone on from where they started , and loads of teachers will tell you examples of how they 've done that and how they 've felt that 's not sufficiently recognised by the measures that they 're subjected to . dr ian johnson : i think what 's important , and maybe it 's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools , is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person . so , that has to be taken deeply into consideration . obviously , the schools provide whatever support they can , but what is the best for the young person at this time ? and that answer will differ from individual to individual . i think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this , and it 's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this . one of the projects that mind will be working on in wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry , where we 'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence , because at the moment a lot of the evidence that we have is data-driven or anecdotal , and i think we want to get to the bottom of how young people feel , and how they find this . sarah 's referred to the curriculum . i think there 's a lot to be done , still , with regard to pru and eotas with the new curriculum , and , hopefully , we 'll be able to outline some of that in terms of questions later on . liz williams : i think it 's a really difficult balance , but it was something that was brought up in the research stages of our report . so , we held a round table during the research period , and participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs . and , obviously , this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups . and they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp , or not properly diagnosed , and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , and , again , these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded . so , when you consider that , you tend to think , actually , diagnosis could be really useful , so that staff are aware of the pupil 's needs , and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour . however , what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child 's condition or additional learning needs , and that the proper support was there , then diagnosis alone was n't of value . so , i think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need , so , again , if the support is n't there , that child is n't going to benefit from diagnosis . and what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive , and for that child , regardless of whether they had an additional learning need or not , to have proper opportunity to progress . dr ian johnson : i do n't think we 're really capable of saying that on an individual level . we 're aware , as you 've heard from previous evidence from heads of education , et cetera , directors of education , that work is going on on an all-wales basis , and there 's obviously an awful lot of work that 's going on on the aces agenda . i referred to being a previous school governor , and that 's somewhere that 's become a trauma-informed school , and they have established that and are widening that base . i think that what the school does though is something that has to loop back , as i said , with the curriculum changes as we 're going forward . there 's a concern that i have at the moment regarding the progress on eotas and pru within the new curriculum , and there 's work that i think will still need to be done , and something that i 'm sure will be considered by this committee when it deals with the curriculum assessment bill when it comes forward later on in the year , because there were comments made by the education minister , i think , in response to suzy davies , in the statement in january , that we 're talking about disallowing areas of the curriculum on the basis of the individual learner , to which i have no concern in itself . however , the emotional and mental health well-being needs of this particularly vulnerable group of people needs to be centre stage . so , the role of the health and well-being area of learning and experience , and the role of mental health and emotional well-being within the curriculum , is hugely important . janet finch-saunders am : it 's very bad in north wales . our figures are very worrying . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a few questions around providing support for learners . you 've set out very clearly what you think needs to happen in your report , your nine points and so on , but what 's your view on the support currently provided , both in a school setting and eotas settings for mental health support ? have you been able to get that sort of information ? have you got a sense of— ? dr ian johnson : the research that we 're going to do is really where we 're at , and that 's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general . i think , in particular , we 're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm , and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys . specifically , i think there 's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range , but we 're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools . my experience of projects that i 've been involved in—i was previously in front of this committee as part of the time to change wales project—was that , overall , it depends quite strongly on the senior management team and their commitment . where the smt has taken a lead , then it feels that schools are really doing something . where the smt are , perhaps , a bit more laissez-faire regarding this , then it feels that maybe schools are not making such a step forward . and to come back to the point , that 's why we feel that whole-school approach guidance needs to be statutory , because we 'll otherwise reach some quite uneven outcomes , because those who are doing it well will really push ahead and those that are not so engaged will not be helping their pupils in the way that they should be . dawn bowden am : you touched , in the beginning of that response , on children being labelled as naughty . to what extent have you come across that ? is that quite prevalent ? is that quite common ? okay . thanks for that . can i just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances , and whether you 've come across any issues relating to welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue—that it 's not been available , welsh-medium support , for those learners ? have you come across that at all ? dr ian johnson : we have n't necessarily come across it , but we have n't been looking for it either . the estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from welsh-medium education to eotas . there are a number of potential reasons for that . that can include the complete lack of eotas provision within a local area . it could be the socio-economic profile , because exclusions , et cetera , are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals , and in many parts of wales the socio-economic profile of a welsh-medium education school is slightly different . we are not aware of any particular work that 's been done to examine the needs and the provision of welsh-medium eotas . therefore , my suspicion , without any particular evidence , would be that it happens on a local authority basis , possibly on an incidental basis , depending on the quality and the ability of staff , and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west wales . dawn bowden am : okay . we can come back to that again , i 'm sure . do you know whether there 's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing eotas , again in terms of mental health conditions , if there 's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision ? have you got any evidence , anecdotal or otherwise , of the impact on that ? sarah stone : not specifically researched on that situation . i think , again , there is so much that we do n't actually know and that we should know a lot more about , but i think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else , and they 're connected with the issues anyway . so , if you understand that there 's a strong link between inequality and exclusion , and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well , that 's a really important issue to understand . so , being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities , and i ca n't emphasis that enough . this is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage . so , being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable . it makes you vulnerable , and i guess the longer that continues i would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be . so , there 's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one . since the publication of our report , we have had an extraordinary level of interest from people concerned about crime . so , we 've talked to the youth justice board , we 've met with the police , there 's a huge level of concern about county lines and about home-growing drug gangs , and the fodder that those young people are for people who will engage them in all sorts of activities , which are hugely damaging both to themselves and also to the wider society . so , i think we need to understand there 's a lot at stake here for wider society in holding young people , and not allowing gaps to grow where they are not held . i would just refer you to the child death review on suicide and suspected suicide by young people , which came out very recently from public health wales and swansea university , and that looked at 33 young people who died by suicide over the past few years . one thing that came through that and was reflected in one of their suggestions for action was that those young people had not been held in education or training or employment , had slipped through all sorts of systems , and were extremely vulnerable . so , i think that 's a really big message : that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they 're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really , really difficult . so , i think that 's my major message on that particular one . liz williams : i suppose we do n't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils , but what we do know and something that is of huge concern , i suppose , to most people is that there 's no central data on how many young people are home schooled . so , it 's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally . also , it is a concern , if children are n't registered with any school , how they get back into school , how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment , if that 's what people think is best for them . so , i think that is a concern : not having that transparency of data . and just to reiterate sarah 's point , i suppose , home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things , so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education , but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion , like loneliness and isolation . that child still is n't with its own peer group . that is something that came out of the men 's research , as sarah mentioned . these men , who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide , were n't always interacting with children their own age , and that did cause problems in later life . so , i think it 's definitely something we do n't know enough about , but i think we need to know more about . </s>

industrial designer : so it 's quite advanced . project manager : what what we did n't talk about is um uh i think it has . marketing : uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat project manager : you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . industrial designer : has uh the signals sent to it . absolutely . yes . i i 've i think we 've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that 's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . project manager : d do you agree ? user interface : no . an original remote control of any tv kind , uh a phillips remote control , y you pay uh industrial designer : yes . yes , but you can you c yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . project manager : . industrial designer : and this one does . project manager : okay . um we 'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . about the project itself , not about the product . um what did you think about uh the process , the project process ? ruud ? user interface : but w um we were n't aware of the prices of the costs . and and that was the the big deal . i if we knew that before , we c we could have made project manager : better decision . industrial designer : we had we had too little information actually . project manager : less . yeah . industrial designer : so there was not really a process of uh marketing : the prices . industrial designer : well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . we we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . so project manager : okay , roo ? any other thoughts on that ? marketing : i agree . project manager : you agree , okay . uh leadership . user interface : fantastic . industrial designer : i think we 're a good team . project manager : i think so too , it 's it 's it 's uh of course a laboratory environment . i missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey roo uh . um yeah , but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation , uh i think we performed pretty well . it it was calibrated just before this meeting . uh the one before , the third meeting . user interface : if it has o_c_r_ , uh i think uh i would use , but uh i i just uh took notes for myself and and and that 's it . it w it w yeah . it was necessary for me to uh project manager : to digitise them . user interface : yeah , because if i want something on the computer , i just type it . i type faster than i write . industrial designer : but i think it 's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . because you have everything in one place and it 's quite easy quite easy it 's it 's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . it 's not quite uh ergonomic . eco ergonomic . user interface : economic . marketing : so ca n't say much about it . project manager : we were n't able to do that . at least the um i was n't explained how to do such a th industrial designer : and a lot of these buttons do n't appear here . so it 's not not uh n not way . project manager : yeah , the project is evaluated . um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . celebrate industrial designer : uh we 're done , we 're finished , i believe . so , are there any more cycles in this process ? i think not . project manager : i do n't believe so . well , maybe we 'd get an email . thank you for your industrial designer : but um how much time did we get for this meeting ? project manager : forty minutes . industrial designer : and how much time is left ? ten minutes . user interface : but you see the problem , </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about evaluation criteria of remote control . </s> industrial designer : it 's important . uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve . um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . but other users who are new to this device need something like that . it 's it 's quite easy . user interface : and a button for disabling the voice recognition . industrial designer : is it spongy ? marketing : that 's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . fancy look and feel . so industrial designer : i believe it 's fancy too . user interface : twenty two . but that 's that 's only for the buttons . project manager : it becomes a very dull remote control , i know . um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . um but uh i agree it 's it 's not a fancy high-tech uh device . definitely not , no . it 's not that innovative . yeah , that 's true . industrial designer : well , maybe it 's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . is it fancy ? marketing : yay . is it ? is it fancy ? project manager : you like the rubber , uh roo . marketing : so uh one ? project manager : no , i 'll i 'll i 'll give it a two . you like tita industrial designer : it has flavour . yes , that 's right . you should taste it . project manager : but but it but that 's fancy in the way um i mean fancy has has a lot of industrial designer : it has to do with fashion , i guess . marketing : so in that way it it 's fancy . project manager : it applies . it yeah . user interface : well , just give it a two . it 's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but looking at the user uh needs , we only uh do n't we do n't have the double-curved case . we w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . that 's two out of three . so i believe uh we are close uh to two . project manager : with the voice recognition feature and uh industrial designer : so i i i think it is . i think it 's innovative . marketing : so uh also a uh two ? industrial designer : i think uh it 's a two . marketing : is it easy to use ? user interface : well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , i think . well , hard it 's not for the for the e for the elderly . they wo n't use it . industrial designer : well , but there are two parts in this remote control . what you see here is is the basic part . everybody can use it , so that 's easy to use . that 's for a novice user . when you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . so in that in that way it is advanced , and i think it 's easy to use for for both uh types of users . user interface : i think i think a three . would n't give it more . marketing : well the p the most important function is easy to use . the the zapping , channel switching , volume . but the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . project manager : okay . uh two or three ? three ? wha wh what would be your guess ? i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . it 's the uh it 's it 's overall . is the device easy to use ? industrial designer : yeah , that 's right . you 're right in that , but i i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , after all , i think personally i would give a two . but project manager : uh roo , a three ? marketing : good question . uh i 'll go uh for the two . industrial designer : so , it 's two , two and three . two threes . so that 's ten . user interface : if you make it a four it will be three in general . industrial designer : so that 's w no , two and a half . user interface : if he makes it a four . not a three . industrial designer : six and four . six and four is ten . divided by four is two and a half . so user interface : a seven , a three no . a four and a three together . industrial designer : four ? user interface : yeah , you have a two , he has a two . three ? marketing : two , two , three user interface : and a three ? project manager : okay , but if i would say a three , then it 's six , and four is ten . divided by four is two point five . user interface : yes . so if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . then you would make a four . if you fill out a four project manager : but i 'm filling in a three . does it will so it will be a two point five . marketing : is it easy to find ? project manager : i have a veto . exactly . it 's not about the content , it 's about okay , um is it easy to f yeah , definitely . industrial designer : it it most definitely is it 's very easy . project manager : we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but i personally give it a one . right , well . the feel of the remote control is spongy . well , uh marketing : this this was a most spongy option . project manager : for the options given , it 's the most spongy one . industrial designer : so there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . they 're out there . project manager : they 're out there . industrial designer : yes , but it 's not good enough , project manager : i 'll give it a one . industrial designer : so it 's a two . user interface : i wan i 'll take one . industrial designer : you take one ? what do you give it ? marketing : well yeah , it depends , 'cause it 's the most spongy we could well , if i give it a one there 'll be one hell of a calculation . user interface : it will be a one . marketing : so i 'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . industrial designer : no no no . uh i 'll i 'll change it , i 'll make it m my my mark will be a four . project manager : the remote control offers enough features . well , ruud , what what do you think about it ? marketing : well , the basic layout does n't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . so industrial designer : basically it 's it 's completely programmable . you can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . user interface : yeah , but it ha does n't has the digits . i believe it 's if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , i do n't i do n't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has . project manager : i think it has . yeah . okay , um let 's give it a number . i 'll give it uh a one . for for the for this t uh type of market , i think it 's a one . user interface : i 'll give a two . industrial designer : yeah , i 'll give it a one . marketing : um i think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that 's like um industrial designer : yes . i i 've i think we 've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that 's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . project manager : the product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . but whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . user interface : but we could could n't uh what what 's the selling price ? fifty ? industrial designer : well , it 's not it 's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . and it 's easier to use because those uh remote controls do n't offer voice recognition well , it 's it 's about one point five . something like that . marketing : should be about one point s seven , user interface : four six seven eight . project manager : because of the response industrial designer : it it 's i i think so too . because you have everything in one place and it 's quite easy quite easy it 's it 's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . it 's not quite uh ergonomic . eco ergonomic . user interface : i it 's not possible project manager : yeah , ten or five . industrial designer : no , it 's it 's just the same product that is already on the market . user interface : y you ca n't continue your uh your line . well , it 's fluffy alright . spongy . a giraffe ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> project manager : right um this is our conceptual design meeting , um i think we 're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , things like that , um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? marketing : thank you . there we go . okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager : let 's start from the inside and work our way out . i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : and most people most people also watch tv in the in the night anyway . user interface : night . industrial designer : but i i think i think the the next one 's the best anyway . and you d you do n't even notice it . i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , i do n't think you 'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and that 'll that would l would last for um well i do i d i 'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i 've never seen one run out . project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it 's on your wrist so it 's on your whole bod it 's on your body the whole time marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm . or the two things not compatible ? user interface : so we have to s look at the life also . marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally project manager : but then maybe that 's looking at someone who 's just sitting on their own rather than marketing : it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , it 's not a thing that people are looking for mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : with w also with the but i 'm just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : is rubber . mm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay , we 'll talk about that so if you finish your and we 'll come back to that . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . project manager : we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . marketing : yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface : so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would n't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh industrial designer : well , yeah we user interface : i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern project manager : i ca n't see that , is that play and stop and things ? okay . right . okay . um i 'm not sure how long we 've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we 've discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ? user interface : the kinetic . project manager : selling point . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , industrial designer : well you cou um . marketing : got you on that okay , did n't realise . project manager : so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , marketing : lcd screen . mm-hmm . okay . user interface : we could use the body , project manager : for the inside . mm-hmm . marketing : okay . and it is just uh although it 's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we 're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , industrial designer : mm no . project manager : we do n't wan na be tacky if we 've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , marketing : mm-hmm . the feel . project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything . it 's just different it 's just different from everything else and i mean , i 'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yeah . i 'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i mean i totally agree . we looked at those remotes , i mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . this would definitely be different enough , i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year 's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it 's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes mm-hmm . user interface : uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . marketing : 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it 's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it 's our product project manager : well they do , um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . obviously it 'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does , without that so i 'm not worried about that . i mean we 've got this memo saying that it 's something that the company 's looking into , so industrial designer : and they 've got in stock , so yeah . project manager : um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it 's hugely expensive we 'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it 's worth thinking about . but i think we 'll find out more about cost afterwards . right i 'm going to wrap it up there . i got a end meeting now message on my mo user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : did it ? marketing : you got to go through . project manager : so i um think we 've probably got about that time before we come back . it 's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and do n't know how long that took . </s>
<s> what were the final decisions made by the team ? </s> industrial designer : yeah . project manager : things like that , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : 'kay . marketing : thank you . there we go . okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager : yeah . marketing : okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that . user interface : 'kay . project manager : let 's start from the inside and work our way out . industrial designer : um , findings , i 've got my nice little picture there . this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment . project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . marketing : mm . artificial light , no . user interface : right . industrial designer : and most people most people also watch tv in the in the night anyway . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . mm . or the two things not compatible ? project manager : like a dual kind of . marketing : mm . so that affects the exterior design . project manager : practical-wise okay . user interface : a remote control , like , so we have to s look at the life also . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , it 's not a thing that people are looking for project manager : okay , right . industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they 've they 've said that they 've they 've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it 's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . project manager : hinged , yeah . user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , project manager : 'kay . industrial designer : but i 'm just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside . user interface : 'kay . project manager : uh marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . user interface : like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer : i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . project manager : we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . marketing : yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it 's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think , okay . 'kay . user interface : so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . and uh second thing is there 's too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , industrial designer : if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this lcd screen . user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . so basically not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . project manager : and then have the and then have the lcd at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface : and the lower distance . and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . project manager : i ca n't see that , is that play and stop and things ? user interface : the kinetic . project manager : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , marketing : lcd screen . mm-hmm . okay . project manager : for the inside . user interface : plast right . marketing : okay . and it is just uh although it 's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we 're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , industrial designer : mm no . project manager : we do n't wan na be tacky if we 've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that 's not really what we 're focusing on , what we 're focusing on is the m you know marketing : the feel . project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything . marketing : 'kay . mm-hmm . is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , project manager : it 's just different from everything else and i mean , i 'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . this would definitely be different enough , i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more user interface : right . project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . user interface : fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it 's lost . marketing : is that right ? industrial designer : oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah . user interface : uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . marketing : 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it 's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it 's our product project manager : well they do , well it is , it is , i think you just address that with um advertising . and that does the work for you . obviously it 'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does , without that so i 'm not worried about that . i mean we 've got this memo saying that it 's something that the company 's looking into , so </s>
<s> what did the team decide on in the last meeting ? </s> project manager : let 's start from the inside and work our way out . i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . project manager : i thought it was u_v_ like user interface : yep . regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . user interface : right . industrial designer : and most people most people also watch tv in the in the night anyway . but i i think i think the the next one 's the best anyway . and that 'll that would l would last for um well i do i d i 'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i 've never seen one run out . project manager : i mean you switch the tv on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . so it 's not the draw on it is n't marketing : or the two things not compatible ? user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like , so we have to s look at the life also . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , industrial designer : yeah i think i i think it would , yeah . project manager : can we think about that ? 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing and it 's marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , it 's not a thing that people are looking for but it 's something to put on the side to think about maybe . industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . or it 's like only specific to plastic or marketing : i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . industrial designer : and you can peel them off yeah . with w also with the but i 'm just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside . marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . project manager : okay , we 'll talk about that so if you finish your and we 'll come back to that . user interface : like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . project manager : we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . marketing : yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it 's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think , okay . trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much user interface : basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , industrial designer : if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this lcd screen . user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface : and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh industrial designer : well , yeah we user interface : i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . project manager : i ca n't see that , is that play and stop and things ? okay . right . okay . um i 'm not sure how long we 've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we 've discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ? user interface : the kinetic . project manager : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . industrial designer : i mean if yeah it is it is qui it 's quite a cool feature to have project manager : i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , user interface : that that way we could upgrade later . project manager : so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , marketing : lcd screen . mm-hmm . okay . project manager : for the inside . marketing : okay . and it is just uh although it 's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we 're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , project manager : we do n't wan na be tacky if we 've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that 's not really what we 're focusing on , what we 're focusing on is the m you know marketing : the feel . project manager : yes . so we could just pick anything . marketing : 'kay . mm-hmm . is that going to be this image i 've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that 's spongy . is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , mm-hmm . mm-hmm . this would definitely be different enough , i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year 's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it 's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , user interface : right . project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . user interface : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . industrial designer : not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . user interface : because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it 's lost . marketing : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it 's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , user interface : uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . marketing : 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it 's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it 's our product project manager : well they do , marketing : since it 's the only one of its kind on the market it 's obviously gon na be ours . project manager : well it is , it is , i think you just address that with um advertising . and that does the work for you . obviously it 'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does , without that so i 'm not worried about that . i mean we 've got this memo saying that it 's something that the company 's looking into , so industrial designer : and they 've got in stock , so yeah . project manager : um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it 's hugely expensive we 'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it 's worth thinking about . but i think we 'll find out more about cost afterwards . right i 'm going to wrap it up there . so i um think we 've probably got about that time before we come back . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about the feedback on the design of the remote control device . </s> industrial designer : people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . project manager : i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ?

<s> what are the actual components found in most remote controls that will be included in this remote design ? </s> project manager : i th i i think yeah um . things like that , user interface : 'kay . project manager : yes if you feel user interface : 'kay . project manager : especially if you do them on too tight and you ca n't get the leverage on them to undo them . industrial designer : people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . project manager : like a right , okay . industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it . you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah but then again marketing : mm-hmm . mm . or the two things not compatible ? mm . so that affects the exterior design . project manager : practical-wise okay . you do get a bit of wear user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . it 's not a thing that people are looking for industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they 've they 've said that they 've they 've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it 's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . for the flip phone . user interface : so is that feature available in like uh titanium , marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . project manager : well that 's been really popular with mobile phones so i do n't see why not . marketing : mm . yeah . project manager : 'kay . user interface : sorry i did n't get the last part , you 're talking of uh-huh . okay . marketing : i do n't s sorry to interrupt , i do n't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that mm-hmm . i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . user interface : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , user interface : mm-hmm . okay . okay . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much industrial designer : but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : oh i think forget about the mirror user interface : so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . like , some some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i i i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . project manager : 'cause if you 're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : and the lower distance . so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . the kinetic . project manager : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . industrial designer : i mean if yeah it is it is qui it 's quite a cool feature to have user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : i think the only industrial designer : so it 's a lot smaller , so it would project manager : so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , marketing : sorry could you repeat that last part ? user interface : and for the sorry . project manager : for the inside . mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm , user interface : plast right . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but that 's not really what we 're focusing on , what we 're focusing on is the m you know marketing : the feel . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they 're so interesting and and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . user interface : fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it 's lost . uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . project manager : well they do , so i 'm not worried about that . </s>
<s> what are the benefits and drawbacks for each battery option mentioned and what did industrial manager suggest to conserve battery life when discussing the design and availability of actual components ? </s> project manager : i th i i think yeah um . so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it . um the minutes from the last time . um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries user interface : 'kay . project manager : yes if you feel it 's okay . user interface : fine . it 's okay with me . industrial designer : um and then we we 're loo looking into battery options . there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . so you wind up your remote control before you use it . project manager : how what kind of how l long can you get out of that , i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . marketing : does does light charge as as sunlight does ? has to be solar . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . project manager : i 'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . uh , i do n't think it counts electric lights mm , but then it would be charging through the day , i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you 've got it charged for the evening . industrial designer : the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you do n't even notice it . i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , i do n't think you 'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . user interface : and are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? industrial designer : um yeah it 's it charges into um some form of it 's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . and that 'll that would l would last for um well i do i d i 'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i 've never seen one run out . project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it 's on your wrist so it 's on your whole bod it 's on your body the whole time industrial designer : yeah but then again marketing : could i just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? i mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging industrial designer : ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . user interface : solar would be slightly expensives . industrial designer : they 're they 're expensive , they do n't project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? industrial designer : yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i 'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the it 's i i think they 're not very resistant to dropping , project manager : practical-wise okay . but do n't calculators have a battery in them as well ? industrial designer : yeah they do , they yeah they 've got dual things , but they 're the batteries are smaller i think . user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like , industrial designer : so the yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , i do n't think you 'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , industrial designer : yeah i think i i think it would , yeah . marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . project manager : we 're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it 's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you would n't lose it so much . marketing : it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they 've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a tv remote , and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical . titanium um very expensive just to process , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they 've they 've said that they 've they 've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it 's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , industrial designer : uh . yeah in in titanium i do n't i do n't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i 've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . project manager : well that 's been really popular with mobile phones so i do n't see why not . 'kay . industrial designer : the problem with it basically is that it 's flat and so you ca n't do lots of curve curved things with it , but um you can you would n't have with the lcd you 'd have the wires coming off , you would n't have that with the with the lcd , you 'd only have that with the printed circuit board . marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . industrial designer : yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out marketing : they 're easy to replace as well , cheap . user interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . industrial designer : yeah that that 's the end of m my uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much industrial designer : i mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an lcd display it 'll completely blank it out , but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . user interface : so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . project manager : it 's a bi i it 's like a g it 's a gadget , it 's a industrial designer : and also if they 've got it if they 've got these parts already in stock , then it wo n't be cheap to re-manufacture them , project manager : i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it 's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , the lcd 's not cheap . marketing : yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a_ or triple a_ batteries 'cause they 've still got to be charged this way have n't they ? industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . project manager : no , it 's fine . marketing : so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , project manager : oh i think so , i think so . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they 're so interesting and and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes user interface : okay . the rubber . marketing : yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it 's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , user interface : for l yeah , the whistle . uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . project manager : well they do , marketing : since it 's the only one of its kind on the market it 's obviously gon na be ours . industrial designer : yeah , depending on the expense of it . and they 've got in stock , so yeah . </s>

industrial designer : ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing project manager : like a dual kind of . industrial designer : but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . marketing : mm . so that affects the exterior design . user interface : it 's twelve point f project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? industrial designer : yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i 'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the it 's i i think they 're not very resistant to dropping , project manager : solar . industrial designer : y i think yeah , practically . i mean calculators you do n't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , project manager : but do n't calculators have a battery in them as well ? industrial designer : yeah they do , they yeah they 've got dual things , but they 're the batteries are smaller i think . user interface : a remote control , like , industrial designer : so the yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , i do n't think you 'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . marketing : right , okay . industrial designer : well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it 's it 's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical . titanium um very expensive just to process , user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it 's like only specific to plastic or industrial designer : uh . yeah in in titanium i do n't i do n't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , industrial designer : rubber , yeah . marketing : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . project manager : so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , marketing : like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . project manager : like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . industrial designer : but um you can you would n't have with the lcd you 'd have the wires coming off , you would n't have that with the with the lcd , you 'd only have that with the printed circuit board . but i 'm just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside . it would n't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ . project manager : i think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gon na be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . industrial designer : is rubber . mm . user interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . industrial designer : i mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an lcd display it 'll completely blank it out , but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : oh i think forget about the mirror user interface : so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would n't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh project manager : okay . right . okay . um i 'm not sure how long we 've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we 've discussed . so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ? user interface : the kinetic . marketing : kinetic ? project manager : it 's a bi i it 's like a g it 's a gadget , it 's a the lcd 's not cheap . industrial designer : yeah to s th well it 's it 's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we 've just got a black and white one , i mean they use them in calculators so . user interface : maybe we could start with the black and white . marketing : yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , we 've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double a_ or triple a_ batteries ? no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a_ or triple a_ batteries 'cause they 've still got to be charged this way have n't they ? industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . so it 's a lot smaller , so it would project manager : um , okay so we 've got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is n't it ? so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , plastic , user interface : for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . marketing : so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , okay . and it is just uh although it 's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we 're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , industrial designer : mm no . project manager : um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , marketing : the feel . project manager : sort of beige and black and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . user interface : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . industrial designer : yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . user interface : okay . the rubber . marketing : for the decisions that we 've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um lcd display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we 're gon na use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that 's how far we 've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? project manager : so i 'm not worried about that . i mean we 've got this memo saying that it 's something that the company 's looking into , so industrial designer : and they 've got in stock , so yeah . project manager : um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it 's hugely expensive we 'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it 's worth thinking about . but i think we 'll find out more about cost afterwards . right i 'm going to wrap it up there . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion of the design of actual components regarding interface design . </s> project manager : things like that , yes if you feel especially if you do them on too tight and you ca n't get the leverage on them to undo them . industrial designer : there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , project manager : wa can you explain that ? industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it . you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . user interface : yep . regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . um yeah it 's it charges into um some form of it 's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , project manager : so it 's not the draw on it is n't industrial designer : no no i do i do n't think the the draw on it would be ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing marketing : or the two things not compatible ? mm . so that affects the exterior design . industrial designer : y i think yeah , practically . i mean calculators you do n't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , user interface : a remote control , like , industrial designer : so the yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , i do n't think you 'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , project manager : okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ? can we think about that ? 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing and it 's marketing : right , okay . project manager : what kind of things do we have to consider there ? can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of industrial designer : well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it 's it 's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they 've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a tv remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they 've they 've said that they 've they 've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it 's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . i 'm no i 'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that 's what they said . um the problem with the casing is that uh there 's quite um there 's quite a few design restrictions that they 've got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . but whether whether or not because we 'd have it in two separate units project manager : hinged , yeah . user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it 's like only specific to plastic or marketing : i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . industrial designer : now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch user interface : sorry i did n't get the last part , you 're talking of industrial designer : oh on the on the lcd screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it 's flat and so you ca n't do lots of curve curved things with it , but um you can you would n't have with the lcd you 'd have the wires coming off , you would n't have that with the with the lcd , you 'd only have that with the printed circuit board . with w also with the but i 'm just wondering whether we want an lcd screen inside . so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ . marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . user interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph industrial designer : but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : oh i think forget about the mirror user interface : so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . and uh second thing is there 's too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . like , some some people have a here you see this ? this is on a i i i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . industrial designer : if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this lcd screen . user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . so basically not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . project manager : can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , user interface : okay and you mean to the project manager : so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , user interface : and the lower distance . project manager : on the lower side . user interface : so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . project manager : i ca n't see that , is that play and stop and things ? or is that volume and channel ? user interface : yeah volume and channel . so keep that m that standardised because that 's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it 's here . this and voice recognition . the kinetic . project manager : it 's a bi i it 's like a g it 's a gadget , it 's a industrial designer : i mean if yeah it is it is qui it 's quite a cool feature to have so it 's a lot smaller , so it would project manager : so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , project manager : okay , okay . industrial designer : um , okay on we 've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gon na be the lcd and the bottom one is gon na be the rubberised buttons . project manager : for the inside . user interface : for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . project manager : um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that 's not really what we 're focusing on , what we 're focusing on is the m you know marketing : the feel . this would definitely be different enough , i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . industrial designer : not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . user interface : okay . the rubber . marketing : for the decisions that we 've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um lcd display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we 're gon na use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that 's how far we 've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? user interface : fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also so , are we looking at voice ? uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . project manager : so i 'm not worried about that . right i 'm going to wrap it up there . </s>
<s> what did the team think about marketing 's suggestion of a sort of stylus to press the touch screen on the device when discussing the design of actual components ? </s> project manager : yes if you feel industrial designer : people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . project manager : like a right , okay . industrial designer : so you wind up your remote control before you use it . it might project manager : i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . project manager : i thought it was u_v_ like industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . project manager : i mean people who live in basement flats there 's not that many people , but there are people . industrial designer : but and most people most people also watch tv in the in the night anyway . project manager : so you 're walking around , you 're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . if you 'd industrial designer : yeah and project manager : i mean you switch the tv on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . industrial designer : yeah but then again project manager : so it 's not the draw on it is n't industrial designer : no no i do i do n't think the the draw on it would be marketing : or the two things not compatible ? industrial designer : they 're they 're expensive , they do n't user interface : another question is like sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like , marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , project manager : can we think about that ? 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing and it 's marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . project manager : we 're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it 's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you would n't lose it so much . marketing : it 's not a thing that people are looking for industrial designer : well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it 's it 's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . user interface : so in this case if you 're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . or it 's like only specific to plastic or industrial designer : it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i 've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . industrial designer : and you can peel them off yeah . project manager : well that 's been really popular with mobile phones so i do n't see why not . industrial designer : with w also with the project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , i mean marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . project manager : like one of the palm pop thing . industrial designer : but i i think they could get a bit easily lost , user interface : absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . industrial designer : yeah that 's i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . if we flip open , now you know how you 've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it 's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think , okay . trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much industrial designer : but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about user interface : so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . project manager : which means user interface : which is industrial designer : if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this lcd screen . user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . project manager : 'cause if you 're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li user interface : but project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , user interface : so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ?

<s> summarize the design and availability of actual components . </s> project manager : i th i i think yeah um . this is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . so i think we 've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we 'll just go over it . um the minutes from the last time . um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we could n't use teletext , it was n't gon na be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we 've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what 's normal . we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal , um . you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries user interface : 'kay . marketing : shall i ? project manager : yes if you feel marketing : thank you . there we go . okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i 'm sorry i 'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager : it 's okay . marketing : sorry project manager . um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we 'll come to that later . so that was one of the first things we did . also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it 's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . so a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan . be interesting to see what our design people make of that . user interface : 'kay . project manager : okay thank you very much . um um , yes , thank you . industrial designer : that screwed in ? project manager : especially if you do them on too tight and you ca n't get the leverage on them to undo them . marketing : i know . industrial designer : okay . um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . okay , first uh the into the method . the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the tv and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . um also in this study i 've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time are n't un unfortunately are n't available . project manager : 'kay . . industrial designer : um , findings , i 've got my nice little picture there . this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what 's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it 's pretty much used for all all tv remotes at the moment . um and then we we 're loo looking into battery options . there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , project manager : wa can you explain that ? i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . marketing : has to be solar . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . project manager : i 'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . uh , i do n't think it counts electric lights mm , but then it would be charging through the day , i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you 've got it charged for the evening . industrial designer : the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you do n't even notice it . i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , i do n't think you 'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . um yeah it 's it charges into um some form of it 's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , project manager : but then if you think about a watch , it 's on your wrist so it 's on your whole bod it 's on your body the whole time industrial designer : ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . marketing : mm . so that affects the exterior design . user interface : it 's twelve point f industrial designer : yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i 'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the it 's i i think they 're not very resistant to dropping , project manager : practical-wise okay . industrial designer : y i think yeah , practically . i mean calculators you do n't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . industrial designer : so the yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , i do n't think you 'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally it 's not something that 's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , industrial designer : well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it 's it 's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit um , the case material , i 've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there 's the plastic which i think we were gon na go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical . titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you 're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but i was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they 've they 've said that they 've they 've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it 's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . i 'm no i 'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that 's what they said . um the problem with the casing is that uh there 's quite um there 's quite a few design restrictions that they 've got on the shape of the case . if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . but whether whether or not because we 'd have it in two separate units user interface : second thing is project manager : hinged , yeah . user interface : yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , industrial designer : uh . yeah in in titanium i do n't i do n't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , project manager : well that 's been really popular with mobile phones so i do n't see why not . 'kay . industrial designer : now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i 'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it 'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but i thought that an lcd type of screen 'cause one they 're incredibly thin um and do n't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch user interface : sorry i did n't get the last part , you 're talking of just what you said i i did n't get the uh meaning of it completely , you 're saying like uh-huh . industrial designer : the problem with it basically is that it 's flat and so you ca n't do lots of curve curved things with it , user interface : okay . industrial designer : but um you can you would n't have with the lcd you 'd have the wires coming off , you would n't have that with the with the lcd , you 'd only have that with the printed circuit board . is rubber . mm . i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , marketing : yeah . i know what you mean , it 's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph industrial designer : but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : oh i think forget about the mirror user interface : and uh second thing is there 's too much of confusion here . no particular remote is standard . industrial designer : yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li user interface : so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . my personal preferences would be like , as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so i would n't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . the kinetic . marketing : kinetic ? project manager : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it 's a bi i it 's like a g it 's a gadget , it 's a the lcd 's not cheap . industrial designer : k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . marketing : i oh i see . right , okay , got you . project manager : um , okay so we 've got battery . the inside components is pretty standardised across the board is n't it ? so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , marketing : so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , okay . and it is just uh although it 's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we 're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we 're not gon na try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , the feel . mm-hmm . yeah . i 'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but i mean i totally agree . we looked at those remotes , i mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . project manager : and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . user interface : okay . the rubber . marketing : for the decisions that we 've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um lcd display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we 're gon na use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . that 's how far we 've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? user interface : fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also uh sorry i did n't mention this , but we 'll be incorporating in the design . marketing : 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it 's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it 's our product </s>
<s> what are the designs of normal remotes and how can the new remote be different from the normal ones ? </s> project manager : put it on in that way . industrial designer : people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . so you wind up your remote control before you use it . you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . user interface : yep . regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple a_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . yeah , okay . project manager : i mean people who live in basement flats there 's not that many people , but there are people . i mean you switch the tv on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . industrial designer : yeah but then again but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y project manager : you do get a bit of wear user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . a remote control , like , industrial designer : w m yeah marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally project manager : well add it in to think about um marketing : right , okay . it 's not a thing that people are looking for industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i 'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . user interface : so in this case if you 're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . so is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it 's like only specific to plastic or industrial designer : it 's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote . marketing : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i 've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . marketing : that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . industrial designer : and you can peel them off yeah . user interface : something like that could be a good idea . it could it would be comfortable to hold on also . industrial designer : with w also with the marketing : i do n't s sorry to interrupt , i do n't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that industrial designer : you could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but there 'd be touch touch buttons , so you would n't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ . project manager : now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , i mean marketing : i just had another idea , i do n't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ . is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . project manager : like one of the palm pop thing . industrial designer : but i i think they could get a bit easily lost , user interface : a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . industrial designer : yeah okay . yeah that 's uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it 's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . project manager : yeah , no , no . marketing : trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much industrial designer : but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about marketing : oh i think forget about the mirror user interface : like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . so we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . project manager : 'cause if you 're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . marketing : no you 'd hold it you do n't if you flip it open then you 'd be would n't you ? is n't that the idea ? you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you 've got your lcd display there and you 've got the buttons there so you 're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , user interface : some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? and technologically innovative also . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern project manager : so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . it 's a bi i it 's like a g it 's a gadget , it 's a industrial designer : i mean if yeah it is it is qui it 's quite a cool feature to have project manager : i think the only yeah , okay . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : and you could yeah . okay . industrial designer : so it 's a lot smaller , so it would project manager : so there 's not a really a decision to be made there , um . the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board lcd or industrial designer : yeah the well i think were we 're going for the lcd on that one , on the buttons , project manager : for the inside . user interface : for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . project manager : but that 's not really what we 're focusing on , what we 're focusing on is the m you know marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they 're so interesting and and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes marketing : which is another beauty of it . project manager : so i think that 's quite a flexible thing . user interface : and finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it 's lost . project manager : well they do , obviously it 'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . the point is that it 's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does , without that so i 'm not worried about that . </s>
<s> how can the cost be cut down if the speech recognition feature is adopted ? </s> project manager : yes if you feel industrial designer : um and then we we 're loo looking into battery options . there 's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , people wo n't it 's it 's basically like wind-up radio . so you wind up your remote control before you use it . it might project manager : i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that 's it for the night ? or industrial designer : you yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you would n't have to wind it for very long , but i do n't i do n't think it 's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got tv . marketing : does does light charge as as sunlight does ? has to be solar . industrial designer : yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . project manager : no , but i mean not many you do n't want to limit your market . i mean people who live in basement flats there 's not that many people , but there are people . mm , but then it would be charging through the day , i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you 've got it charged for the evening . industrial designer : the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you do n't even notice it . i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you 'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , i do n't think you 'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . user interface : and are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? industrial designer : 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . and that 'll that would l would last for um well i do i d i 'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i 've never seen one run out . yeah and yeah but then again and th for the same the same reason , you 're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you 're finished with it marketing : i mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ? industrial designer : but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they 're qui they 're quite big and they all they all look i identical . marketing : mm . so that affects the exterior design . user interface : solar would be slightly expensives . project manager : expensive as well . what kind of price are we looking at for industrial designer : they 're they 're expensive , they do n't project manager : i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? industrial designer : yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i 'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the it 's i i think they 're not very resistant to dropping , project manager : but do n't calculators have a battery in them as well ? user interface : sorry . w w which one would last the longest , because we do n't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . industrial designer : w m yeah so the yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , i do n't think you 'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . marketing : it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , project manager : can we think about that ? 'cause if we 're doing the kinetic thing and it 's marketing : should n't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right , okay . project manager : okay , right . industrial designer : if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which i 'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they 've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a tv remote , and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical . titanium um very expensive just to process , user interface : so is that feature available in like uh titanium , industrial designer : uh . yeah in in titanium i do n't i do n't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is marketing : it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . i 've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . industrial designer : with w also with the marketing : i do n't s sorry to interrupt , i do n't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that user interface : absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would project manager : it would have to be attached . marketing : they 're easy to replace as well , cheap . user interface : and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . industrial designer : uh yeah . yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , i mean you 'd you 'd actually have two separate you 'd have two separate circuit boards but they 'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you 'd have some linking . marketing : i 'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i 'm not sure how it would fit in . project manager : we 're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . yeah , no , no . marketing : trying to think of other features we can build in that would n't cost too much industrial designer : i mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an lcd display it 'll completely blank it out , but i do n't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , i 'm not sure about project manager : which means user interface : which is project manager : and then be able to touch that for the other controls , user interface : so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . all are confusing and in inconsistent . okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> the chair : on tabling of documents , we have minister sajjan . mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we worked with the auditor general to increase the funding of the auditor general 's office in 2018-19 , and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added . we support the auditor general , unlike the conservative government , which fired 60 people from the auditor general 's office . we are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon , and i certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate . hon . andrew scheer : the prime minister is again engaged in revisionist history . he well knows that it was the auditor general 's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies , which did not affect its ability to do the job . in fact , as the interim auditor general , john wiersema , said , we would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for parliament . only the government 's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the auditor general 's ability to give canadians the answers they deserve , and we wonder why . this is the government that can not explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars ' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone . they ca n't identify that . then there is , of course , the $ 35-billion infrastructure bank , which has completed precisely zero projects . are these the reasons the prime minister is so intent on withholding funds from the auditor general ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , talking of revisionist history , stephen harper 's conservatives cut $ 6.5 million from the auditor general 's budget and fired 60 staff . on the contrary , we worked with the auditor general 's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff . we will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency . we will continue to respect the officers of parliament , whom the conservatives , in their time in office , showed no respect for . we will continue to move forward in a way that has led , for example , to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help canadians . the conservatives do n't seem to want that debate or vote . mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . the chair : we will continue with mr.blanchet . mr.blanchet has the floor . mr. yves-franois blanchet : that will be enough . i would be remiss if i allowed the prime minister to mislead people quite unintentionallyi say this in accordance with the standing orders . when we introduce a bill , we discuss it at second reading , we vote , we continue to discuss it and we send it to committee . all that can be done very quickly . however , we must be able to amend and improve this bill . that is how the normal parliament works . the government does n't like being in a minority situation . it behaves as if it were a majority government , but it is not . can we follow the real procedures of parliament , do a proper job , and then have a vote that is likely to suit the majority of members , not just the prime minister ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , my hon . colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic . the covid-19 crisis requires different actions on our part . that is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago . we have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill , if they had amendments to propose . that is how we are taking action to help canadians quickly during this crisis , and that is what we will continue to do . mr. chair , as i have said from the beginning , we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help canadians . however , we need the opposition parties to actually choose to help canadians and not to play political games . i hope we 're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon . hon . bill morneau ( minister of finance ) : mr.chair , i would like to thank the hon . member for his question . it is of course very important to be transparent . when the situation is stable , we will have mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , most of the provinces in canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of june . why is the liberal government unable to do so as well ? hon . bill morneau : i understand the importance of transparency and that is why we are trying every day to explain our investments to canadians and to continue to be transparent with them . we will continue with our approach , which is one of transparency . we know that it 's very difficult to make projections given the very dynamic nature of the situation . we think our approach of providing information daily is appropriate and we will continue to be transparent about our investments . i will continue to provide daily information on our measures and investments . projections are clearly very difficult to make . however , when the situation is more stable , we will be able to provide more information to canadians . in the meantime , we will be adapting to the situation on a daily basis and making sure that we have the information we need to make our decisions and to make sure that canadians understand our situation . hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : mr. chair , i thank my colleague for his important question . i had a good conversation with the mayor of niagara falls recently , and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector . that 's exactly why we 've extended the wage subsidy until the end of august . there is the ceba loan , the $ 40,000 loan . there is also spending through feddev in my colleague 's region . if he has clear , specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with , i would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation . mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , we absolutely agree . it is important for businesses to have an understanding of the programs that we 've put in place . we have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart . we 've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we 've put forward hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . hon . lawrence macaulay ( minister of veterans affairs ) : mr. chair , the fact is that when we inherited the government , veterans affairs needed a lot of support from government . in fact , at that time , we invested $ 10 billion to make sure that veterans affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans , like the pension for life , the centre of excellence on ptsd and the chronic pain centre of excellence . all of these things are so important . we have to realize that with government previously the chair : we 'll now go back to mr. chiu . hon . marc garneau ( minister of transport ) : mr. chair , as we have said , we and our allies are deeply concerned with beijing 's decision to impose a national security law on hong kong . with hundreds of thousands of canadians living in hong kong , we have a vested interest in its stability and prosperity , the foundations of which are hong kong 's relative autonomy and basic freedoms . the proposed law would also undermine the one country , two systems framework . hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . mr. kenny chiu : okay , here 's a quick question . the communist chinese government has lied about covid-19 . they have issued statements against canada and they have yet to release the two canadians being held hostage . my constituents are concerned over this . when will this government listen to canadians and call for a stronger , more effective and truly independent international investigation into covid-19 's origin ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we are dealing with a global pandemic , covid-19 . it is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent , open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible . the chair : we go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i think the member is talking about two separate things . any test kit that would be approved by health canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit . furthermore , it 's really important that test kits that are approved by health canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test . mr. chair , i am happy to follow up with the member opposite 's office when she is able to provide me with the name of the company . as you can imagine , there are many vendors trying to the chair : we go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : we have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days , depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor . canadians expect us , at health canada , to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in canada . i appreciate the member opposite 's interest in urgent and quick approvals ; however , sometimes , depending on the company , there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment . should she wish me to check into the process for a particular the chair : we will go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force , which is , as you know , a group of scientists who have been funded by the government of canada the chair : we 'll go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . hon . steven guilbeault ( minister of canadian heritage ) : first , mr. chair , i would like to offer my congratulations to the new auditor general for her appointment . on behalf of the government , i would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , her role is essential to our democracy . we are eager to work with her . she 's more than welcome to share her concerns directly with the government . i can assure her that my mr. pat kelly : mr. chair , i did n't ask him if he would like to work with the auditor general . i asked him if he will give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job . hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , our government has added 38 permanent staff positions to her office , while the conservative government , under their leadership , cut the funding for more than 60 mr. pat kelly : mr. chair , through you , i caution the minister to not mislead this house . if he will look at the committee transcripts of the time , he will know that it was the auditor general 's decision to reduce their own budget . the conservatives did not cut positions . that is a matter of fact . the point is that the auditor general now does not have the money to do her job . she has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits . when will this government give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job ? hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the auditor general , an independent officer of parliament . if the auditor general identifies the need for additional resources , we will work with the office of the auditor general to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively . mr. pat kelly : mr. chair , this is n't an if situation . the auditor general has already told this government that her office does not have funds . this has been ongoing since 2018. i would ask the minister to please stop with the platitudes and actually just say yes or no . will the government give the auditor general the money that the auditor general has already asked for ? hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , we have already increased the budget of the office of the auditor general in the 2018-19 period . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ( brossardsaint-lambert , lib . ) ) : there 's a point of order . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . hon . patty hajdu : we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec mr. richard martel : i think that 's a canned speech . according to a survey conducted by the universit de trois-rivires in quebec , the saguenaylac-saint-jean region is apparently the most economically affected by covid-19 . we have many projects , but they depend on the government 's leadership to be carried out . our region has forestry , the aluminum sector , gnl qubec , tourism , the port of saguenay , davie canada , a military base and a tax centre . it 's all here . we know we 'll have to get the economy moving again soon . when will the government act to help our region ?

<s> what were the statements discussed by the members ? </s> hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr. chair , today i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2019 annual report on the rcmps use of the law enforcement justification provisions . this report addresses the rcmp 's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime , which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the criminal code . this report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used . the chair : on tabling of documents , we have minister sajjan . mr. richard cannings ( south okanaganwest kootenay , ndp ) : mr. chair , i rise here today to present a petition from canadian citizens in support of motion m-1 , which was placed in this house by my colleague the member for new westminsterburnaby on the green new deal . these citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that canada must act with ambition and urgency . they call on the government to support m-1 , a made in canada green new deal , to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies , closing offshore tax havens , and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying , unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy . mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . the chair : i just want to remind the honourable members , when presenting petitions , to be as concise as possible . i notice they 're starting to stretch a bit and it 's something we all tend to do . now we 'll go to statements by members . the first statement will be from mr. lefebvre . mr. marc dalton ( pitt meadowsmaple ridge , cpc ) : mr. chair , pitt meadows is one of canada 's most beautiful communities . it 's tucked in between the fraser and pitt rivers and is in the shadow of golden ears mountain . most of the area consists of farmland , golf courses , parks and conservation areas . it also has pitt lake , which is among the largest freshwater tidal lakes in the world . pitt meadows ' history dates back thousands of years with katzie first nation . in the 1900s dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today 's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries . it 's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to vancouver and has one of the nation 's busiest general aviation airports . last weekend the community came together to celebrate pitt meadows day a little differently because of covid . in a great show of community spirit , from their front yards and balconies , thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city . i am thankful to have raised my family here , taught in the schools and to now be the member of parliament representing this wonderful community . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . the chair : i give the floor to mr.mackinnon . mr. majid jowhari ( richmond hill , lib . ) : mr. chair , i would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of richmond hill . week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty . i want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services . i would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which , upon receiving these donations , redoubled their efforts to serve their communities . special thanks go to the mon sheong foundation long-term care centre , divine favour senior homecare , the community & home assistance to seniors , the true compassion home health centre , blue door , the mosaic interfaith out of the cold program , yellow brick house , hill house hospice , community living york south , and parya trillium foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of richmond hill . the compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in parliament . mr. jol godin ( portneufjacques-cartier , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . our planet is dealing with the covid-19 pandemic . our daily lives have been turned upside down . i am thinking of you , our seniors , valuable individuals who built our country . you have gone through a very restrictive confinement . you have had to sacrifice time spent with your families . our students also had to adapt . their school year was turned on its head . our graduating class , especially , saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish . the future belongs to them . they must follow their dreams . i want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things . we have all taken on our important responsibility , that of following the guidelines . the results have been most compelling in my riding . i want to say how proud i am to represent you here , in the canadian parliament . i thank each and everyone of you . you are helping portneufjacques-cartier flourish . you have shown resilience , creativity , innovation and solidarity . that is commendable . together , we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , talking of revisionist history , stephen harper 's conservatives cut $ 6.5 million from the auditor general 's budget and fired 60 staff . on the contrary , we worked with the auditor general 's office and increased its funding and added the equivalent of 38 new full-time staff . we will continue to demonstrate openness and transparency . we will continue to respect the officers of parliament , whom the conservatives , in their time in office , showed no respect for . we will continue to move forward in a way that has led , for example , to proposing debate and voting on important legislation this afternoon to help canadians . the conservatives do n't seem to want that debate or vote . mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . the chair : mr.blanchet has the floor . right hon . justin trudeau : we are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon , we are proposing to debate it . it is the role and responsibility of all of us in the house to exchange ideas and to work together to help canadians . that is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon . it is about helping people with disabilities , increasing the flexibility of the cerb , and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it . i look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite . mr.chair , my hon . colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic . the covid-19 crisis requires different actions on our part . that is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago . we have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill , if they had amendments to propose . that is how we are taking action to help canadians quickly during this crisis , and that is what we will continue to do . the chair : mr.singh , you have the floor . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , let 's talk about those measures . one of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for canadians living with disabilities . now the government 's plan is only going to help 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . will the government commit to helping all canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , as i have said from the beginning , we look forward to continuing to work with the members opposite to keep moving forward to help canadians . however , we need the opposition parties to actually choose to help canadians and not to play political games . i hope we 're going to be able to actually have a debate and a vote on this important legislation this afternoon . mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , most of the provinces in canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of june . why is the liberal government unable to do so as well ? that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? mr. chair , this government has come way short of meeting the canadian demand for personal protective equipment . some equipment procured from overseas has been substandard and could n't be used . because of the shortage , in my riding of niagara west , dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an n95 mask . compared to early march , when will the government finally begin to produce enough ppe in canada to meet canadian demand ? hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . mr. dean allison : at a time when the prime minister has ordered canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed , at a time when canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over skype , at a time when canadians are not allowed to get married , at a time when canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park , at a time when restaurants are being fined $ 800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced , in these times , the prime minister 's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing . mr. chair , why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the prime minister ? why the double standard ? mr. kenny chiu : mr. chair , the hong kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year . this is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people , proportional to canada 's population . it is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as beijing imposes the national security law in hong kong . has our government started preparing a list of names for magnitsky-style sanctions , yes or no ? i thank the minister for responding . again , however , words are not enough . it 's time for action , because the chinese embassy has said , in response to canada 's expressed concern , that they deplore , reject and condemn our response and our concerns thus far . what are the conditions for this government using magnitsky sanctions should china continue to incarcerate canadians and jeopardize the human rights of its citizens ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . the chair : before we go to the honourable minister , i just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly . go ahead , minister . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the auditor general , an independent officer of parliament . if the auditor general identifies the need for additional resources , we will work with the office of the auditor general to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : this is beginning to sound a bit like debate . we will proceed . mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . hon . patty hajdu : we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : i now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places . with that done , monsieur martel , you may now go ahead.. mr. richard martel : sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of canada and for saguenaylac-saint-jean . canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change . currently , our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems , and on top of that , there is the covid-19 crisis . who will defend our forestry workers ? mr. colin carrie : madame chair , the website says , to protect the health and safety of the public , offenders , parole board ... members and staff in response to the covid-19 pandemic , the pbc is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference . however , when referring to victim participation , the pbc says it has implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims ... the ability to participate ... via telephone . if video conference is an option for staff and inmates , why is it not for victims ? mr. richard cannings : a big part of tourism in my riding is the wine sector . one thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption . that exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements . the industry has proposed a trade-legal replacement , the wine growers ' value-added program . the finance minister has known about this situation for months . can he assure this house and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program ? hon . bill morneau : we continue to work on this issue . we recognize how important the wine industry is in b.c. , and i assure the honourable member that i will come back to him and give him an update . mr. randall garrison : the government knows i 've been calling on friends , family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who can not . not only do we need routine blood donations , but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of covid-19 , we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered . this ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason . again , when will the minister of health act to get this ban lifted ? six years ago this week , i tabled a motion in the house that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men , men who have sex with men and trans women . that was five ministers of health ago . at the time , i was told certain things had to happen before the ban could be lifted . these were all due to be completed earlier this year , before the covid crisis . since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion , m-41 , that i put on the notice paper this week , would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with m-41 immediately ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.trudel , you have the floor . mr. denis trudel ( longueuilsaint-hubert , bq ) : madamchair , i join my colleague in extending my good wishes to you on portugal 's national day . apart from the fact that it is probably the most beautiful riding in quebec , the riding of longueuilsaint-hubert has surely been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic , both in terms of health and the economy . there are industries here , but also many service businesses , including bars , restaurants and theatres . but we are n't close to being able to go back and see a show by wajdimouawad or fredpellerin , and that 's a shame . we must work to calm the anxiety of these people . the arts sector was the first to stop its activities and will be the last to resume them . there is a lot of anxiety . the cerb ends on july4 . will the government extend the cerb , with an employment incentive ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the hon . minister has the floor . we will have a very short answer from the honourable minister . </s>

sajjan ( minister of national defence ) : mr. chair , pursuant to standing order 32 , i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2018-19 progress report on canada 's national action plan for the implementation of united nations security council resolutions on women , peace and security . mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . mr. marc dalton ( pitt meadowsmaple ridge , cpc ) : mr. chair , pitt meadows is one of canada 's most beautiful communities . it 's tucked in between the fraser and pitt rivers and is in the shadow of golden ears mountain . most of the area consists of farmland , golf courses , parks and conservation areas . it also has pitt lake , which is among the largest freshwater tidal lakes in the world . pitt meadows ' history dates back thousands of years with katzie first nation . in the 1900s dutch immigrants drained and diked the marshes allowing for today 's bumper crops of cranberries and blueberries . it 's hard to believe that this community is only a short commute to vancouver and has one of the nation 's busiest general aviation airports . last weekend the community came together to celebrate pitt meadows day a little differently because of covid . in a great show of community spirit , from their front yards and balconies , thousands of residents came out to cheer for first responders and essential workers as we paraded throughout the city . i am thankful to have raised my family here , taught in the schools and to now be the member of parliament representing this wonderful community . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . mr. steven mackinnon ( gatineau , lib . ) : mr.chair , on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues , i want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. we know that , owing to the pandemic , graduation celebrations will be different this year , as students will be deprived of their prom , their graduation ceremony and , in some cases , their goodbyes to friends and teachers . i know how disappointed students from the high schools of duversant , lecarrefour , nicolas-gatineau , de l'rablire , collge saint-alexandre , collge nouvelles frontires , collge saint-joseph , philemon-wright and other regional schools , are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis . however , that takes nothing away from their accomplishment . so when they receive their diploma , here is what i will say to them : surge ahead ! the future belongs to you . be ambitious , follow your dreams and , most importantly , continue to change the outaouais and the world ! the class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time . mr. majid jowhari ( richmond hill , lib . ) : mr. chair , i would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of richmond hill . week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty . i want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services . i would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which , upon receiving these donations , redoubled their efforts to serve their communities . special thanks go to the mon sheong foundation long-term care centre , divine favour senior homecare , the community & home assistance to seniors , the true compassion home health centre , blue door , the mosaic interfaith out of the cold program , yellow brick house , hill house hospice , community living york south , and parya trillium foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of richmond hill . the compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in parliament . mr. brad vis ( missionmatsquifraser canyon , cpc ) : mr. chair , covid-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives . for many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely . the sad reality is that even before the crisis hit , most rural canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable internet connection , even though internet is an essential service . those in underserved areas , including many parts of missionmatsquifraser canyon , can not work from home and their children can not keep up with their classmates . for many of my indigenous constituents , internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies do n't want to serve them . i , along with my colleagues , launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions . we call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban canada . this is an issue i will continue to press on until results are achieved . mr. jol godin ( portneufjacques-cartier , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . our planet is dealing with the covid-19 pandemic . our daily lives have been turned upside down . i am thinking of you , our seniors , valuable individuals who built our country . you have gone through a very restrictive confinement . you have had to sacrifice time spent with your families . our students also had to adapt . their school year was turned on its head . our graduating class , especially , saw their dream of a proper graduation vanish . the future belongs to them . they must follow their dreams . i want to say to all the essential staff and the many support organizations that they are really changing things . we have all taken on our important responsibility , that of following the guidelines . the results have been most compelling in my riding . i want to say how proud i am to represent you here , in the canadian parliament . i thank each and everyone of you . you are helping portneufjacques-cartier flourish . you have shown resilience , creativity , innovation and solidarity . that is commendable . together , we will get through this ordeal and come out stronger . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . the bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities . we can always recognize that this is important , and every party should be open to it . we will also increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks . we will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it . i am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures , all or some of the measures . we want to help canadians . we look forward to debating and voting on this later today . we are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon , we are proposing to debate it . it is the role and responsibility of all of us in the house to exchange ideas and to work together to help canadians . that is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon . it is about helping people with disabilities , increasing the flexibility of the cerb , and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it . i look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite . mr.chair , my hon . colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic . the covid-19 crisis requires different actions on our part . that is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago . we have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill , if they had amendments to propose . that is how we are taking action to help canadians quickly during this crisis , and that is what we will continue to do . mr.chair , we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit . we hope to be able to debate it . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , i can tell you what the right way is . don from burnaby sent me a note saying he 's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened . he is now dependent on the cerb . he wants to go back to work , but there 's no work . he sent an email saying he 's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he 's frightened that if the cerb runs out , and it is planned to run out at the end of this month , then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet . will the prime minister extend the cerb so don does not have to live in fear ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , as i said , and as we have been saying from the beginning , we will continue to be there to support canadians who need it . the member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for canadians this afternoon . we are proposing to help canadians with disabilities , to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the cerb . he does n't even want to debate those things . he does n't even want to be voting on them . will the ndp allow us to move forward on these important measures for canadians ? mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , let 's talk about those measures . one of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for canadians living with disabilities . now the government 's plan is only going to help 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . will the government commit to helping all canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so ? mr. chair , i appreciate that the prime minister accepts that his plan only helps 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . let 's talk about the 60 % who are n't being helped . they are veterans living with disabilities , those who receive cpp and those who receive disability payments . often it 's the poorest of canadians living with disabilities who wo n't be helped with the plan the government is proposing . will the government help all canadians living with disabilities ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . mr. alain rayes : that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , we absolutely agree . it is important for businesses to have an understanding of the programs that we 've put in place . we have been consulting with businesses on the appropriate way to extend the wage subsidy so that we can continue to support businesses as they turn towards a safe restart . we 've also looked very carefully at how we can ensure that the programs that we 've put forward hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . mr. dean allison : at a time when the prime minister has ordered canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed , at a time when canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over skype , at a time when canadians are not allowed to get married , at a time when canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park , at a time when restaurants are being fined $ 800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced , in these times , the prime minister 's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing . mr. chair , why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the prime minister ? why the double standard ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . mr. chair , we are dealing with a global pandemic , covid-19 . it is critically important that all countries in the world work together in a transparent , open and respectful manner so that we understand what is going on and how we can bring it to an end as quickly as possible . the chair : before we go to the honourable minister , i just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly . go ahead , minister . hon . patty hajdu : i appreciate the member opposite 's interest in urgent and quick approvals ; however , sometimes , depending on the company , there may be further questions and further tests that need to be run to ensure the accuracy or safety of that equipment . should she wish me to check into the process for a particular mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : this is beginning to sound a bit like debate . we will proceed . mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . hon . patty hajdu : we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . hon . bill blair : madam chair , let me assure the member that when quebec made a request for assistance at the beginning of april , we answered the call . when they asked for an extension of that , we said we would continue to provide that assistance . i had a conversation today with minister guilbault , my counterpart in quebec , and we have renewed our commitment to continuing to provide assistance . that assistance can take additional forms and can include involving the canadian red cross , but we remain committed to providing the assistance that quebec needs . i 'd like to assure this house that we have assured quebec that the canadian armed forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job . we 're working very hard with the province of quebec . we 're working with the canadian armed forces and the canadian red cross . we will be there for quebeckers because they need our help , and as long as they need our help , we 'll be there to support them . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : i now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places . with that done , monsieur martel , you may now go ahead.. hon . marc garneau : madamchair , in all cases similar to mr.gauthier 's , the government of canada , through its consular services , tries to do the best it can under the circumstances . this file is still active . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : ms. sahota , may i remind you to please direct your questions through the chair ? hon . marco mendicino ( minister of immigration , refugees and citizenship ) : thank you , madam chair . i thank my honourable colleague for the question . i 'm glad to hear that minister blair was able to provide information on the specific case he raises . with regard to his question , we 're happy to provide it to him in due course . mr. colin carrie : madame chair , the website says , to protect the health and safety of the public , offenders , parole board ... members and staff in response to the covid-19 pandemic , the pbc is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference . however , when referring to victim participation , the pbc says it has implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims ... the ability to participate ... via telephone . if video conference is an option for staff and inmates , why is it not for victims ? hon . marco mendicino : madam chair , as i 've said , of course we are going to confirm the status of that particular request . in the meantime , as i 've said on a number of occasions , victims are able to participate in these hearings . this is consistent with the fairness of those hearings and the due process we accord to them . hon . bill morneau : we continue to work on this issue . we recognize how important the wine industry is in b.c. , and i assure the honourable member that i will come back to him and give him an update . mr. randall garrison : the government knows i 've been calling on friends , family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who can not . not only do we need routine blood donations , but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of covid-19 , we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered . this ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason . again , when will the minister of health act to get this ban lifted ? six years ago this week , i tabled a motion in the house that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men , men who have sex with men and trans women . that was five ministers of health ago . at the time , i was told certain things had to happen before the ban could be lifted . these were all due to be completed earlier this year , before the covid crisis . since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion , m-41 , that i put on the notice paper this week , would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with m-41 immediately ? hon . carla qualtrough : madamchair , as i said in english , we 're working very hard to continue to be there for all canadians , whether it 's through the cerb or the canada emergency wage subsidy . please excuse me , i 'm very tired . i 'll continue in english . we 're going to have news on this very soon , madam chair , but the point is that we want to make sure that all of these programs work well together , whether it 's the wage subsidy or the cerb . we want to make sure that we incentivize work , but we still continue to be there for canadians . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the hon . minister has the floor . mr. bragdon , you have time for a short question . we will have a very short answer from the honourable minister . </s>
<s> which groups did the members discuss to have been impacted heavily ? </s> hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr. chair , today i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2019 annual report on the rcmps use of the law enforcement justification provisions . this report addresses the rcmp 's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime , which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the criminal code . this report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used . ms. elizabeth may ( saanichgulf islands , gp ) : mr. chair , i rise to present two petitions . they both pertain to the protection of our natural world . one is an e-petition , and it relates to the threat to pollinators globally . we know that honey bees and other pollinators are essential to food production . the petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators , particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids . the european union has taken action on this . the petitioners call on the government of canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in canada to protect our pollinators . the second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales . these iconic whales are much beloved in saanichgulf islands , throughout coastal british columbia and indeed across canada . the petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline , more action for boat-free safety zones , more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance , and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct . mr. garnett genuis ( sherwood parkfort saskatchewan , cpc ) : mr. chair , for over 10 years , members of parliament from various parties have been trying to pass legislation to deal with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking . irwin cotler , borys wrzesnewskyj , senator salma ataullahjan and i have all proposed bills on this . the petitioners want the house to support bill s-204 . this is another bill that would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent . i 'm sure petitioners would want me to add that , given the urgency of this issue , perhaps the government could consider bringing forward a government bill on this issue , which would allow the process to move much faster . mr. richard cannings ( south okanaganwest kootenay , ndp ) : mr. chair , i rise here today to present a petition from canadian citizens in support of motion m-1 , which was placed in this house by my colleague the member for new westminsterburnaby on the green new deal . these citizens point out that climate change has escalated into a global climate emergency and that canada must act with ambition and urgency . they call on the government to support m-1 , a made in canada green new deal , to take bold and rapid action to adopt socially equitable climate action to tackle the climate emergency and address worsening socio-economic and racial inequalities at the same time while ending fossil fuel subsidies , closing offshore tax havens , and supporting workers impacted by the transition by creating well-paying , unionized jobs in the shift to a clean and renewable energy economy . mr. gord johns ( courtenayalberni , ndp ) : mr. chair , it 's an honour and privilege to table e-petition 2577 , which was sponsored by chris alemany from port alberni and is supported by 5,183 petitioners . they 're calling on the government of canada to work urgently across party lines and in partnership with provincial and territorial governments to implement a guaranteed , consistent , national and livable universal basic income system for all canadians . the petition is very timely , coming almost one year to the day since the completion of the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls , which also called on the government to establish a guaranteed annual livable income for all canadians . whether it 's about providing a safety net to get through a global pandemic , the means to keep your children out of poverty at any time , or simply being able to afford safe housing or transportation , it 's time for canada to have this conversation . mr. paul manly ( nanaimoladysmith , gp ) : mr. chair , it 's an honour and a privilege to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of nanaimoladysmith . people are concerned about gas fracking and the use of methane and the destruction that methane causes to our atmosphere and with climate change . they 're calling on the government to commit to upholding the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples and the truth and reconciliation commission 's calls to action by immediately halting all existing and planned construction of the coastal gaslink project on the wet'suwet'en territory , and by ordering the rcmp to dismantle their exclusion zone and to stand down . they also call on the government to schedule nation-to-nation talks between the wet'suwet'en nation and the federal and provincial governmentswhich is something that we 're happy to see has been happening and i commend the government for that effortand to prioritize the implementation of the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples . mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . mr. paul lefebvre ( sudbury , lib . ) : mr. chair , i just want to say thank you to the industrious people of sudbury who have risen to the challenge and joined forces in the face of covid-19 . i am proud of all my constituents , and all canadians , including first responders , volunteers , health care and essential workers , local miners , the farmers and produce growers who are feeding our families , and local businesses who are staying connected with their staff . i also salute all our homegrown innovations such as prostitch and king sportswear face masks ; crosscut distillery hand sanitizer ; nobel prize winner snolab 's work on ventilators , which earned a federal contract ; vale canada 's $ 1 million in seed capital to small firms developing covid-19 health solutions ; and many more . we are all in the same boat , but we will get out of it together . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . mr. majid jowhari ( richmond hill , lib . ) : mr. chair , i would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of richmond hill . week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty . i want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services . i would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which , upon receiving these donations , redoubled their efforts to serve their communities . special thanks go to the mon sheong foundation long-term care centre , divine favour senior homecare , the community & home assistance to seniors , the true compassion home health centre , blue door , the mosaic interfaith out of the cold program , yellow brick house , hill house hospice , community living york south , and parya trillium foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of richmond hill . the compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in parliament . mr. brad vis ( missionmatsquifraser canyon , cpc ) : mr. chair , covid-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives . for many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely . the sad reality is that even before the crisis hit , most rural canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable internet connection , even though internet is an essential service . those in underserved areas , including many parts of missionmatsquifraser canyon , can not work from home and their children can not keep up with their classmates . for many of my indigenous constituents , internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies do n't want to serve them . i , along with my colleagues , launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions . we call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban canada . this is an issue i will continue to press on until results are achieved . mr. michael mcleod ( northwest territories , lib . ) : mr. chair , canada has been awarded its first-ever equator prize from the united nations development programme . congratulations go to lutsl k ' dene first nation and the northwest territory mtis nation , with support from deninu k'ue first nation and the yellowknives dene first nation , for the establishment of the thaidene nn territorial protected area . it 's 14,000 square kilometres of the most beautiful land and waters you 'll find anywhere on earth . i would also like to thank the previous minister of the environment for securing canada 's $ 7.9-million commitment , along with our visit to celebrate the new park last year . the award is given to groups that have exemplified actions to protect critical ecosystems and biodiversity for generations to come and to show how indigenous peoples and local communities have confronted legacies of disadvantage and discrimination in support of their communities and the world at large . congratulations to lutsl k ' . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . hon . tim uppal ( edmonton mill woods , cpc ) : mr. chair , i rise to give thanks and recognition to the contributions of many businesses and organizations across my riding of edmonton mill woods that have stepped up in a major way during this pandemic . i joined my friends in the filipino community who partnered with mill woods ' calvary community church to deliver care packages to seniors . varinder bhullar and his green scholars of alberta team and dil-e-punjab restaurant provided thousands of free meals . sikh youth edmonton delivered free groceries to families , seniors and students . edmonton towing and its full team with dukh nivaran gudwara prepared food packages for any truckers who were coming through edmonton . the bhartiya cultural society hindu temple provided free meals to anyone who needed them . punjab insurance and the punjab chain of restaurants provided free meals in downtown edmonton . the staff , nurses and doctors of grey nuns community hospital in the heart of mill woods have been keeping people safe and healthy . i want to thank our mill woods community as a whole for its continued strength , resilience and compassion as we move forward together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . mr. yves-franois blanchet ( beloeilchambly , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . we may have a chance here to replace a problem with a good opportunity . this morning , we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government , which i feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil . we agree with the chocolate pudding . we are favourable to helping people with a disability . people do n't know the rules . they do n't knowi am telling them nowthat a bill can be divided . it can be cut into parts and voted on in parts . the rest of the bill can be enhanced . i am saying to the prime minister that , if he presents the part on disabled individuals , it will be passed at the speed of light . he wo n't even see it happen . is he prepared to divide the bill , so that we can work together to help people with a disability ? right hon . justin trudeau : the bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities . we can always recognize that this is important , and every party should be open to it . we will also increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks . we will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it . i am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures , all or some of the measures . we want to help canadians . we look forward to debating and voting on this later today . we are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon , we are proposing to debate it . it is the role and responsibility of all of us in the house to exchange ideas and to work together to help canadians . that is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon . it is about helping people with disabilities , increasing the flexibility of the cerb , and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it . i look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite . mr.chair , my hon . colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic . the covid-19 crisis requires different actions on our part . that is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago . we have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill , if they had amendments to propose . that is how we are taking action to help canadians quickly during this crisis , and that is what we will continue to do . mr.chair , we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit . we hope to be able to debate it . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , let 's talk about those measures . one of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for canadians living with disabilities . now the government 's plan is only going to help 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . will the government commit to helping all canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so ? mr. chair , i appreciate that the prime minister accepts that his plan only helps 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . let 's talk about the 60 % who are n't being helped . they are veterans living with disabilities , those who receive cpp and those who receive disability payments . often it 's the poorest of canadians living with disabilities who wo n't be helped with the plan the government is proposing . will the government help all canadians living with disabilities ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , that 's the exact problem with the liberal proposal . it 's a tax credit approach , which excludes the vast majority of canadians living with disabilities . that is the wrong approach . we made it very clear that if the government extends the cerb , if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all canadians living with disabilities , we will move forward . will the government do that ? mr. alain rayes : the parliamentary budget officer himself does not understand why the federal government can not deliver an economic update when the provinces can . why are the government and the minister defying the parliamentary budget officer , who is an independent officer and is requesting an economic update ? that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? mr. chair , this government has come way short of meeting the canadian demand for personal protective equipment . some equipment procured from overseas has been substandard and could n't be used . because of the shortage , in my riding of niagara west , dentists have to pay up to 10 times the amount for an n95 mask . compared to early march , when will the government finally begin to produce enough ppe in canada to meet canadian demand ? hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . mr. dean allison : at a time when the prime minister has ordered canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed , at a time when canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over skype , at a time when canadians are not allowed to get married , at a time when canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park , at a time when restaurants are being fined $ 800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced , in these times , the prime minister 's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing . mr. chair , why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the prime minister ? why the double standard ? mr. kenny chiu : mr. chair , the hong kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year . this is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people , proportional to canada 's population . it is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as beijing imposes the national security law in hong kong . has our government started preparing a list of names for magnitsky-style sanctions , yes or no ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . mr. gabriel ste-marie : madamchair , it is n't about squabbling , it 's about needs . the share that the federal government is giving is n't enough . we should act now , before we see a possible second wave . what we 're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care . this is n't good enough . the government must act quickly . can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with quebec and the provinces on this exact topic , in september at the latest ? we ca n't afford to wait . hon . bill blair : i 'd like to assure this house that we have assured quebec that the canadian armed forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job . we 're working very hard with the province of quebec . we 're working with the canadian armed forces and the canadian red cross . we will be there for quebeckers because they need our help , and as long as they need our help , we 'll be there to support them . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the honourable minister has time for a short answer . mr. richard martel : sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of canada and for saguenaylac-saint-jean . canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change . currently , our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems , and on top of that , there is the covid-19 crisis . who will defend our forestry workers ? hon . mlanie joly : of course , we believe in the importance of regional economic development . that 's why we 're always there to defend our forestry workers . i will also be pleased to work with my colleague , the minister of natural resources , who is very familiar with the matter and who knows the challenges faced by the various businesses in the forestry sector , as well as the employees . we will always be there to support employees and create more jobs across quebec and the country . mr. colin carrie : madame chair , the website says , to protect the health and safety of the public , offenders , parole board ... members and staff in response to the covid-19 pandemic , the pbc is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference . however , when referring to victim participation , the pbc says it has implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims ... the ability to participate ... via telephone . if video conference is an option for staff and inmates , why is it not for victims ? mr. richard cannings : a big part of tourism in my riding is the wine sector . one thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption . that exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements . the industry has proposed a trade-legal replacement , the wine growers ' value-added program . the finance minister has known about this situation for months . can he assure this house and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program ? mr. randall garrison : the government knows i 've been calling on friends , family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who can not . not only do we need routine blood donations , but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of covid-19 , we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered . this ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason . again , when will the minister of health act to get this ban lifted ? six years ago this week , i tabled a motion in the house that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men , men who have sex with men and trans women . that was five ministers of health ago . at the time , i was told certain things had to happen before the ban could be lifted . these were all due to be completed earlier this year , before the covid crisis . since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion , m-41 , that i put on the notice paper this week , would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with m-41 immediately ? mr. maxime blanchette-joncas : we read that the government wants to gradually replace the canada emergency response benefit by using the canada emergency wage subsidy . that 's all well and good , but seasonal industries are n't entitled to it under the current criteria . if the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions , he must commit to helping workers . if the clientele is n't there , the industry will simply no longer exist . we still need the canada emergency response benefit . we simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work . the question is simple : will the government commit to renewing it ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the hon . minister has the floor . we will have a very short answer from the honourable minister . </s>
<s> what was said about the auditor general ? </s> mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we worked with the auditor general to increase the funding of the auditor general 's office in 2018-19 , and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added . we support the auditor general , unlike the conservative government , which fired 60 people from the auditor general 's office . we are now proposing that we sit down to debate legislation this afternoon , and i certainly hope that members opposite will vote for debate . hon . andrew scheer : the prime minister is again engaged in revisionist history . he well knows that it was the auditor general 's office that volunteered to make administrative efficiencies , which did not affect its ability to do the job . in fact , as the interim auditor general , john wiersema , said , we would not have proposed if we didnt think it was the right thing to do and that wed be able to carry out our role for parliament . only the government 's refusal to grant that extra funding is hampering the auditor general 's ability to give canadians the answers they deserve , and we wonder why . this is the government that can not explain where 20,000 infrastructure projects went and where five billion dollars ' worth of supposed infrastructure investments have gone . they ca n't identify that . then there is , of course , the $ 35-billion infrastructure bank , which has completed precisely zero projects . are these the reasons the prime minister is so intent on withholding funds from the auditor general ? mr. chair , it 's no surprise that the prime minister likes to reach back into history from before the 2015 election to justify his position . the 2015 election was the only time he got more votes than the conservative party did , so i understand why he likes to live in the past . in may , the interim auditor general said , ten years ago , we were completing about 27 performance audits every year . with our current resources , we expect to be able to deliver 14 performance audits each year . that 's half the number of audits , despite a massive explosion in government spending . the auditor general 's office has requested more funds to be able to do the job that canadians expect to be done . will the prime minister give those additional funds to the auditor general 's office , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . mr.chair , we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit . we hope to be able to debate it . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , i can tell you what the right way is . don from burnaby sent me a note saying he 's an arts worker and there is no forecast for his job to be reopened . he is now dependent on the cerb . he wants to go back to work , but there 's no work . he sent an email saying he 's faced with a grim realityhis wordsand he 's frightened that if the cerb runs out , and it is planned to run out at the end of this month , then he will have no way to afford to make ends meet . will the prime minister extend the cerb so don does not have to live in fear ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : mr.chair , can the prime minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of june ? mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , most of the provinces in canada are working on tabling economic updates by the end of june . why is the liberal government unable to do so as well ? the liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic , but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with canadians . in times of crisis , monitoring the situation is more important than ever . i repeat my question : why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of june , when the provinces are doing so ? that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? mr.chair , one month ago , the prime minister announced with great fanfare that the eligibility criteria for the $ 40,000emergency loans for businesses would be more flexible to help self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends to have access to them . however , as of todayit has been four weeks since that announcementbusinesses are still banging their heads on the doors of their financial institutions . they do not have access to the information because it is not available on official websites . in addition , even senior officials confirmed to me during a technical call on june2 , last tuesday , that this information would not be available for several weeks . can the minister of finance , who says he wants to act quickly to help our businesses , explain why , after four weeks , it is still not possible to get the information the prime minister promised us from his doorstep ? mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : mr. chair , i thank my colleague for his important question . i had a good conversation with the mayor of niagara falls recently , and we believe in the importance of the tourism sector . that 's exactly why we 've extended the wage subsidy until the end of august . there is the ceba loan , the $ 40,000 loan . there is also spending through feddev in my colleague 's region . if he has clear , specific projects in the tourism sector that he needs help with , i would ask that he please come and see me and have a conversation . mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . hon . lawrence macaulay ( minister of veterans affairs ) : mr. chair , the fact is that when we inherited the government , veterans affairs needed a lot of support from government . in fact , at that time , we invested $ 10 billion to make sure that veterans affairs was put in place and that we could provide the appropriate supports for veterans , like the pension for life , the centre of excellence on ptsd and the chronic pain centre of excellence . all of these things are so important . we have to realize that with government previously hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . the chair : we go back to ms. gallant . we go back to ms. gallant . before we go to the honourable minister , i just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly . go ahead , minister . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i assume the member opposite is talking about the work of the immunity task force , which is , as you know , a group of scientists who have been funded by the government of canada mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . hon . steven guilbeault ( minister of canadian heritage ) : first , mr. chair , i would like to offer my congratulations to the new auditor general for her appointment . on behalf of the government , i would also like to offer her our full support and collaboration mr. pat kelly : i share the minister 's wish to congratulate the new auditor general on her position . i will now ask him again when he will give her the funds she needs to do her job . hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , her role is essential to our democracy . we are eager to work with her . she 's more than welcome to share her concerns directly with the government . i can assure her that my mr. pat kelly : mr. chair , i did n't ask him if he would like to work with the auditor general . i asked him if he will give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job . mr. chair , through you , i caution the minister to not mislead this house . if he will look at the committee transcripts of the time , he will know that it was the auditor general 's decision to reduce their own budget . the conservatives did not cut positions . that is a matter of fact . the point is that the auditor general now does not have the money to do her job . she has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits . when will this government give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job ? hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the auditor general , an independent officer of parliament . if the auditor general identifies the need for additional resources , we will work with the office of the auditor general to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively . mr. pat kelly : mr. chair , the auditor general has consistently , since 2018 , told this government that the office does n't have enough funds . it 's not a mystery . the auditor general has told the public accounts committee that it can not do its job . it 's the first time in history that the auditor general has had to tell public accounts that they do n't have the resources to do their job . it 's not a matter of if the auditor general needs more funds . the auditor general could n't be more clear . when will this government actually do the right thing and fully fund the office of the auditor general ? mr. chair , this is n't an if situation . the auditor general has already told this government that her office does not have funds . this has been ongoing since 2018. i would ask the minister to please stop with the platitudes and actually just say yes or no . will the government give the auditor general the money that the auditor general has already asked for ? hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , we have already increased the budget of the office of the auditor general in the 2018-19 period . mr. gabriel ste-marie ( joliette , bq ) : thank you , madamchair . first , i would like to take this opportunity to say hi from portugal . i would also like to inform you that i will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend , the member for lac-saint-jean . obrigado . while quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to covid-19 at $ 3billion , ottawa is transferring around $ 115million , which is not even4 % . does the government recognize that this is clearly insufficient ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : madamchair , the minister says that this is a substantial transfer . yes , it is a lot of money . the government is giving about $ 115million to quebec , but that is not even 4 % of what is being requested . does the minister recognize that much more is needed ? madamchair , it is n't about squabbling , it 's about needs . the share that the federal government is giving is n't enough . we should act now , before we see a possible second wave . what we 're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care . this is n't good enough . the government must act quickly . can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with quebec and the provinces on this exact topic , in september at the latest ? we ca n't afford to wait . hon . bill blair : i 'd like to assure this house that we have assured quebec that the canadian armed forces will continue to provide support until such time as other trained professional people are able to do that job . we 're working very hard with the province of quebec . we 're working with the canadian armed forces and the canadian red cross . we will be there for quebeckers because they need our help , and as long as they need our help , we 'll be there to support them . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . mr. michael cooper ( st. albertedmonton , cpc ) : thank you , madam chair . it was all the way back on march 25 that the minister of finance stated that help for the energy sector was coming within hours , possibly days . well , as it turns out , it has n't been hours . it has n't been days . it has n't even been weeks . indeed , months later , help has yet to arrive . seventy-seven days after the minister made that statement , not a single energy company has received financing under edc , the bdc , or the leeff program . as the energy sector faces an unprecedented liquidity crisis , how can this government possibly justify such a delay ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : ms. sahota , may i remind you to please direct your questions through the chair ? hon . marco mendicino ( minister of immigration , refugees and citizenship ) : thank you , madam chair . i thank my honourable colleague for the question . i 'm glad to hear that minister blair was able to provide information on the specific case he raises . with regard to his question , we 're happy to provide it to him in due course . mr. richard cannings : a big part of tourism in my riding is the wine sector . one thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption . that exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements . the industry has proposed a trade-legal replacement , the wine growers ' value-added program . the finance minister has known about this situation for months . can he assure this house and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program ? hon . bill morneau : we continue to work on this issue . we recognize how important the wine industry is in b.c. , and i assure the honourable member that i will come back to him and give him an update . hon . carla qualtrough : madamchair , as i said in english , we 're working very hard to continue to be there for all canadians , whether it 's through the cerb or the canada emergency wage subsidy . please excuse me , i 'm very tired . i 'll continue in english . we 're going to have news on this very soon , madam chair , but the point is that we want to make sure that all of these programs work well together , whether it 's the wage subsidy or the cerb . we want to make sure that we incentivize work , but we still continue to be there for canadians . mr. maxime blanchette-joncas : we read that the government wants to gradually replace the canada emergency response benefit by using the canada emergency wage subsidy . that 's all well and good , but seasonal industries are n't entitled to it under the current criteria . if the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions , he must commit to helping workers . if the clientele is n't there , the industry will simply no longer exist . we still need the canada emergency response benefit . we simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work . the question is simple : will the government commit to renewing it ? hon . mlanie joly : madamchair , i know , of course , that the restaurant sector has been much affected . i have a great deal of empathy for what entrepreneurs and my colleague are going through in his riding . that 's why we are currently helping our smes . we have money for economic development . the money is available through canada economic development , or ced . if my colleague wants to work with me to provide support to restaurant owners and other restaurants in longueuil , i 'd be very happy to do so . </s>
<s> what was the issue around the cerb ? </s> the chair ( hon . anthony rota ( nipissingtimiskaming , lib . ) ) : i call this meeting to order . welcome to the 20thmeeting of the special committee on the covid-19 pandemic . as a reminder to all members , in order to avoid issues with sound , members participating in person should not be connected to the video conference . i want to remind those who are participating by video conference that , when they talk , they must use the channel that corresponds to the language they are speaking in . as usual , please direct your remarks through the chair . we are moving on to ministerial announcements . i understand that there are no ministerial announcements today , so we 'll move on . we will now move on to document submissions . the honourable minister , mr. blair . hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr. chair , today i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2019 annual report on the rcmps use of the law enforcement justification provisions . this report addresses the rcmp 's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime , which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the criminal code . this report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used . mr. kevin lamoureux ( winnipeg north , lib . ) : mr. chair , like canada , guyana is part of the commonwealth , and many constituents of winnipeg north have raised the issue with regard to the presidential election back in march , when it was being called into question . there have been some very positive indications in recent days , but the petitioners are asking the government of canada , and in fact all members of parliament , to be aware of what 's taking place in guyana , and as much as possible , to be advocates for democracy and make sure that we 're being diligent in supporting what the people of guyana want to see . ms. sylvie brub ( abitibibaie-jamesnunavikeeyou , bq ) : mr.chair , unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals have prompted former member romeo saganash , whose commitment i commend , to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the viens commission in quebec . the bloc is open to the idea , but we should n't wait for such an inquiry to be recommended to take action . there are already potential solutions for taking action . commissions have been issuing reports for decades , and ottawa has been tabling them . last year alone , the viens report and the report stemming from the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls contained dozens of recommendations . the federal government must work with indigenous peoples , quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the rcmp . police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation . let 's take action . mr. steven mackinnon ( gatineau , lib . ) : mr.chair , on behalf of myself and my parliamentary colleagues , i want to congratulate students from our high school class of 2020. we know that , owing to the pandemic , graduation celebrations will be different this year , as students will be deprived of their prom , their graduation ceremony and , in some cases , their goodbyes to friends and teachers . i know how disappointed students from the high schools of duversant , lecarrefour , nicolas-gatineau , de l'rablire , collge saint-alexandre , collge nouvelles frontires , collge saint-joseph , philemon-wright and other regional schools , are not to be able to celebrate their five years of incredible efforts surrounded by their families and friends who were by their side on a daily basis . however , that takes nothing away from their accomplishment . so when they receive their diploma , here is what i will say to them : surge ahead ! the future belongs to you . be ambitious , follow your dreams and , most importantly , continue to change the outaouais and the world ! the class of 2020 will be remembered for a long time . mr. majid jowhari ( richmond hill , lib . ) : mr. chair , i would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of richmond hill . week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty . i want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services . i would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which , upon receiving these donations , redoubled their efforts to serve their communities . special thanks go to the mon sheong foundation long-term care centre , divine favour senior homecare , the community & home assistance to seniors , the true compassion home health centre , blue door , the mosaic interfaith out of the cold program , yellow brick house , hill house hospice , community living york south , and parya trillium foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of richmond hill . the compassionate generosity demonstrated by these donors and organizations makes me proud to represent my community in parliament . mr. brad vis ( missionmatsquifraser canyon , cpc ) : mr. chair , covid-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives . for many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely . the sad reality is that even before the crisis hit , most rural canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable internet connection , even though internet is an essential service . those in underserved areas , including many parts of missionmatsquifraser canyon , can not work from home and their children can not keep up with their classmates . for many of my indigenous constituents , internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies do n't want to serve them . i , along with my colleagues , launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions . we call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban canada . this is an issue i will continue to press on until results are achieved . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we very much look forward to working with the new auditor general to ensure that her office has the ability to continue the important audits and transparency measures that are foundational to our institutions . speaking of what is foundational to our institutions , this afternoon we 're putting forward a bill that would help canadians across the country , and we 've proposed to debate and vote on that bill . it actually looks like the conservatives and other opposition parties might not want this . they have been complaining about not having debates and votes in parliament , and now they 're proposing not to have them . that 's a little head-scratching . we hope they 're going to help canadians . mr. yves-franois blanchet ( beloeilchambly , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . we may have a chance here to replace a problem with a good opportunity . this morning , we heard many groups and organizations that represent people with a disability express their concerns over the bill introduced by the government , which i feel is chocolate pudding containing cod liver oil . we agree with the chocolate pudding . we are favourable to helping people with a disability . people do n't know the rules . they do n't knowi am telling them nowthat a bill can be divided . it can be cut into parts and voted on in parts . the rest of the bill can be enhanced . i am saying to the prime minister that , if he presents the part on disabled individuals , it will be passed at the speed of light . he wo n't even see it happen . is he prepared to divide the bill , so that we can work together to help people with a disability ? right hon . justin trudeau : we are not proposing only to vote on this bill this afternoon , we are proposing to debate it . it is the role and responsibility of all of us in the house to exchange ideas and to work together to help canadians . that is exactly what we are proposing this afternoon . it is about helping people with disabilities , increasing the flexibility of the cerb , and expanding the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses have access to it . i look forward to debating this with my colleagues opposite . mr.chair , my hon . colleague seems to completely forget that we are going through a pandemic . the covid-19 crisis requires different actions on our part . that is why we provided the text of the bill to the opposition parties four days ago . we have been working with them for hours over the past three or four days to amend the bill , if they had amendments to propose . that is how we are taking action to help canadians quickly during this crisis , and that is what we will continue to do . mr.chair , we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit . we hope to be able to debate it . mr. chair , as i said , and as we have been saying from the beginning , we will continue to be there to support canadians who need it . the member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for canadians this afternoon . we are proposing to help canadians with disabilities , to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the cerb . he does n't even want to debate those things . he does n't even want to be voting on them . will the ndp allow us to move forward on these important measures for canadians ? mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , let 's talk about those measures . one of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for canadians living with disabilities . now the government 's plan is only going to help 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . will the government commit to helping all canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so ? mr. chair , i appreciate that the prime minister accepts that his plan only helps 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . let 's talk about the 60 % who are n't being helped . they are veterans living with disabilities , those who receive cpp and those who receive disability payments . often it 's the poorest of canadians living with disabilities who wo n't be helped with the plan the government is proposing . will the government help all canadians living with disabilities ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , that 's the exact problem with the liberal proposal . it 's a tax credit approach , which excludes the vast majority of canadians living with disabilities . that is the wrong approach . we made it very clear that if the government extends the cerb , if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all canadians living with disabilities , we will move forward . will the government do that ? mr. alain rayes : the liberal government announced hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending during the pandemic , but it still refuses to provide an economic update in order to be transparent with canadians . in times of crisis , monitoring the situation is more important than ever . i repeat my question : why does this government not want to table an economic update by the end of june , when the provinces are doing so ? that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . mr. dean allison : at a time when the prime minister has ordered canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed , at a time when canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over skype , at a time when canadians are not allowed to get married , at a time when canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park , at a time when restaurants are being fined $ 800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced , in these times , the prime minister 's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing . mr. chair , why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the prime minister ? why the double standard ? mr. kenny chiu : mr. chair , the hong kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year . this is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people , proportional to canada 's population . it is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as beijing imposes the national security law in hong kong . has our government started preparing a list of names for magnitsky-style sanctions , yes or no ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . the chair : before we go to the honourable minister , i just want to remind the honourable members to place their questions through the chair and not directly . go ahead , minister . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : this is beginning to sound a bit like debate . we will proceed . mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . hon . patty hajdu : we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : mr.ste-marie , you have the floor . mr. gabriel ste-marie : madamchair , it is n't about squabbling , it 's about needs . the share that the federal government is giving is n't enough . we should act now , before we see a possible second wave . what we 're seeing today are the results of massive disinvestment by the federal government in health care . this is n't good enough . the government must act quickly . can the government commit to better funding to the health care sector and to organizing a meeting with quebec and the provinces on this exact topic , in september at the latest ? we ca n't afford to wait . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : you may have a very short question , mr. may . mr. shaun chen ( scarborough north , lib . ) : madam chair , as humanity battles covid-19 , we are confronted by the stark realities of another disease . on may 25 , george floyd fell unconscious and died as a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes . this all happened after the 46-year-old black man was handcuffed and put in a position where he could do no harm . in canada , we have come a long way since viola desmond , yet there is much more to do . anti-black racism is institutionalized , hidden under dominant narratives of a free and multicultural society . hatred has no boundaries , whether it is against black communities or is anti-asian sentiment fuelled by covid-19 . the question always is this : who is next ? we must all stand up together against hatred and for justice and reconciliation , to dismantle systems of oppression that long remained unquestioned . recent data from statistics canada shows that canada is failing black youth , creating the conditions that push them into the justice system . to the minister of diversity and inclusion and youth , my question is this : what is the government doing to address the unique challenges faced by black youth ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : you have time for a very short question , ms. mathyssen . the honourable minister has time for a short answer . i now have to interrupt for a few moments to allow our technicians to change places . with that done , monsieur martel , you may now go ahead.. mr. richard martel : sustainable forestry development is at the heart of the economic development of canada and for saguenaylac-saint-jean . canadians have reason to be proud of the use of the boreal forest in the fight against climate change . currently , our innovative forest industry is experiencing many problems , and on top of that , there is the covid-19 crisis . who will defend our forestry workers ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : ms. sahota , may i remind you to please direct your questions through the chair ? mr. colin carrie : madame chair , the website says , to protect the health and safety of the public , offenders , parole board ... members and staff in response to the covid-19 pandemic , the pbc is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference . however , when referring to victim participation , the pbc says it has implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims ... the ability to participate ... via telephone . if video conference is an option for staff and inmates , why is it not for victims ? mr. richard cannings : a big part of tourism in my riding is the wine sector . one thing that has allowed the wine industry to grow so dramatically in the past few decades is the excise tax exemption . that exemption could likely end very soon if it is found to be non-compliant with our trade agreements . the industry has proposed a trade-legal replacement , the wine growers ' value-added program . the finance minister has known about this situation for months . can he assure this house and the industry that the government will act immediately to implement this program ? hon . bill morneau : we continue to work on this issue . we recognize how important the wine industry is in b.c. , and i assure the honourable member that i will come back to him and give him an update . mr. randall garrison : the government knows i 've been calling on friends , family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who can not . not only do we need routine blood donations , but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of covid-19 , we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered . this ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason . again , when will the minister of health act to get this ban lifted ? six years ago this week , i tabled a motion in the house that called for an end to this homophobic and transphobic ban on blood donations from gay men , men who have sex with men and trans women . that was five ministers of health ago . at the time , i was told certain things had to happen before the ban could be lifted . these were all due to be completed earlier this year , before the covid crisis . since we appear to have cross-party support for my new motion , m-41 , that i put on the notice paper this week , would the minister and the government agree to support a unanimous consent motion to proceed with m-41 immediately ? the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the hon . minister has the floor . mr. bragdon , you have time for a short question . we will have a very short answer from the honourable minister . </s>
<s> summarize what was said on the gba+ analysis ? </s> hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : mr. chair , today i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2019 annual report on the rcmps use of the law enforcement justification provisions . this report addresses the rcmp 's use of specified provisions within the law enforcement justification regime , which is set out in subsections 25 to 25 of the criminal code . this report also documents the nature of the investigations in which these provisions were used . hon . harjit s. sajjan ( minister of national defence ) : mr. chair , pursuant to standing order 32 , i have the honour to table , in both official languages , the 2018-19 progress report on canada 's national action plan for the implementation of united nations security council resolutions on women , peace and security . mr. brad vis ( missionmatsquifraser canyon , cpc ) : mr. chair , covid-19 has changed and challenged how we go about our daily lives . for many this includes a shift to working from home or attending school remotely . the sad reality is that even before the crisis hit , most rural canadians simply did not have access to a strong and stable internet connection , even though internet is an essential service . those in underserved areas , including many parts of missionmatsquifraser canyon , can not work from home and their children can not keep up with their classmates . for many of my indigenous constituents , internet services are stuck in the 1990s because telecom companies do n't want to serve them . i , along with my colleagues , launched community consultations to address this critical issue and provide solutions . we call on the government to outline and implement a concrete action plan to address internet connectivity deficits between rural and urban canada . this is an issue i will continue to press on until results are achieved . mrs. claude debellefeuille ( salaberrysurot , bq ) : mr.chair , this is not the time for governments to get complacent about covid-19 . however , the last few days have shown that we are once again dealing with a reckless prime minister . first , he locked down parliament to avoid being accountable to the opposition , while the economic recovery must be prepared . he is refusing to provide an economic update , even though the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . we need to know how much flexibility we have in case of a second wave of the pandemic . he is refusing to hold a first ministers meeting on unconditional health transfers . the increase quebec needs is for hiring health care staff before a second wave , and not after it . finally , today , he is refusing to negotiate with any party to get his bill passed . he is behaving as if he had a majority government . this is not a time for recklessness . governing means anticipating . i am asking the prime minister to pull himself together . right hon . justin trudeau ( prime minister ) : mr.chair , not only are we introducing a bill this afternoon to help canadians with the canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities , but we are also proposing to the opposition parties that we hold a debate and a vote on that . i hope the opposition parties will allow a vote and a debate in the house on this important bill . hon . andrew scheer : mr. chair , the prime minister wants parliamentarians to vote on aspects of the government 's spending . we want the auditor general to be able to examine that government spending . under the government , the auditor general has had to do more with less , and her ability to conduct audits is being affected . the auditor general has indicated that she will be able to do half as many audits , despite an almost doubling in the size of government spending . i have a simple question . will the prime minister give the auditor general the money she needs to do her job , yes or no ? right hon . justin trudeau : the bill that we are proposing this afternoon will certainly help people living with disabilities . we can always recognize that this is important , and every party should be open to it . we will also increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit from four-week intervals to two weeks . we will also expand the scope of the wage subsidy so that more businesses will have access to it . i am always willing to work with members of the opposition to ensure that we adopt these measures , all or some of the measures . we want to help canadians . we look forward to debating and voting on this later today . mr.chair , we are introducing legislation this afternoon that will directly help canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the canada emergency response benefit . we hope to be able to debate it . mr. chair , as i said , and as we have been saying from the beginning , we will continue to be there to support canadians who need it . the member opposite is not actually looking at the fact that we are proposing three significant helps for canadians this afternoon . we are proposing to help canadians with disabilities , to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the cerb . he does n't even want to debate those things . he does n't even want to be voting on them . will the ndp allow us to move forward on these important measures for canadians ? mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , let 's talk about those measures . one of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for canadians living with disabilities . now the government 's plan is only going to help 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . will the government commit to helping all canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so ? mr. chair , i appreciate that the prime minister accepts that his plan only helps 40 % of canadians living with disabilities . let 's talk about the 60 % who are n't being helped . they are veterans living with disabilities , those who receive cpp and those who receive disability payments . often it 's the poorest of canadians living with disabilities who wo n't be helped with the plan the government is proposing . will the government help all canadians living with disabilities ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , our proposal will help 100 % of canadians who receive the disability tax credit , including many veterans . the fact is that we are there to support the disability community . we are there to support canadians with disabilities . why is the ndp not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation ? the chair : mr. singh , we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer . mr. jagmeet singh : mr. chair , that 's the exact problem with the liberal proposal . it 's a tax credit approach , which excludes the vast majority of canadians living with disabilities . that is the wrong approach . we made it very clear that if the government extends the cerb , if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all canadians living with disabilities , we will move forward . will the government do that ? mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : mr.chair , can the prime minister tell us whether we will have an economic update by the end of june ? hon . bill morneau ( minister of finance ) : mr.chair , i would like to thank the hon . member for his question . it is of course very important to be transparent . when the situation is stable , we will have mr. alain rayes : that is incredible . when we listen to the minister and the prime minister talk , you would think we were in the pesky terrible twos phase that children go through , when they keep saying no , no , no . i find it funny that the provinces are able to table an economic update in a crisis situation . the opposition parties are asking for it , as are experts and officials . when the time comes for the government to listen to the scientists , it has no problem doing so . however , if people do not think like the government , it ignores them . the provinces are doing it , the opposition parties are calling for it and the parliamentary budget officer is calling for it . why will the minister of finance not table an economic update so that all members of parliament can do their verification work ? the chair : mr.rayes , you have 45seconds left . mr. dean allison ( niagara west , cpc ) : mr. chair , canada 's unemployment rate stands at 13.7 % . that 's the highest it 's been in almost four decades . many industries , like travel , hospitality and tourism , are getting crushed . we rely on a lot of hospitality and tourism in my riding of niagara west . can the government tell us what their plans are to help the travel , hospitality and tourism industry that so many of my constituents depend on ? mr. dean allison : mr. chair , the message from the president and ceo of the canadian chamber of commerce , perrin beatty , and also other industries , is that we need a clear and coherent plan from this government because there 's a whole hodgepodge of regulations and confusion about what 's going to happen through the strategy . what i 've told the government is that we need a strategy to reflect local conditions that is consistent and has a clear timeline so that businesses can begin to open safely and with confidence . what is the government doing to make this happen ? hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , i 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . we have mobilized over 700 canadian companies to help them retool and rescale their efforts to make more personal protective equipment in canada as part of a made-in-canada initiative . we 're going to continue to work with industry to build up domestic capacity . hon . anita anand ( minister of public services and procurement ) : mr. chair , the honourable member 's questions were tainted with inaccuracies . regarding the flights that returned from china without federal cargo , air canada did reimburse the federal government for that amount . in addition , with regard to the n95 masks that were referenced , the government of canada will not pay for masks that it does not use . furthermore , as my colleague minister bains just stated , we are mobilizing and retooling the domestic industry . over half of the face shields that we have received were produced in canada . mr. dean allison : at a time when the prime minister has ordered canadians to stay home and businesses to remain closed , at a time when canadians have had to say goodbye to their relatives over skype , at a time when canadians are not allowed to get married , at a time when canadians are being fined for taking their kids to the park , at a time when restaurants are being fined $ 800 for allowing customers to eat outside and not being socially distanced , in these times , the prime minister 's son attended a mass gathering with thousands of people while not socially distancing . mr. chair , why is it that there seems to be one set of rules in this country for some people but a different set for the prime minister ? why the double standard ? mr. kenny chiu : thank you , mr. chair . thank you , minister , for answeringor respondingto my question , although that really did not provide an answer , in my humble opinion . part of the side effect of spending hundreds of millions of dollars is inflation . my constituents in stevestonrichmond east are overwhelmingly finding this government 's support for seniors inadequate . the opposition has put forward clear proposals , such as a one-time tax-free withdrawal being allowed for an rrsp or a rrif . so far , the government has not taken any action on this . why is the government ignoring suggestions to help canadian seniors ? mr. chair , the hong kong government has arrested 9,000 civilians just in the past year . this is equivalent to the arrest of 42,000 people , proportional to canada 's population . it is anticipated that more unjust incarcerations will occur as beijing imposes the national security law in hong kong . has our government started preparing a list of names for magnitsky-style sanctions , yes or no ? hon . marc garneau : mr. chair , we have been very clear . we will continue to encourage all parties to engage in peaceful and meaningful dialogue to address the legitimate concerns expressed by the hong kong population . canada will always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedom of the press around the world . the chair : we go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i think the member is talking about two separate things . any test kit that would be approved by health canada would be accessible to wherever that company chose to market that test kit . furthermore , it 's really important that test kits that are approved by health canada be accurate and have been tested with rigour with regard to their ability to provide credible and accurate information to the people who are using that test . the chair : we go back to ms. gallant . mrs. cheryl gallant : how long will it take for an antibody test to be approved by this government once you have the name of the company and the test and the evidence in front of you ? hon . patty hajdu : we have an expedited process that could be completed in as little as five to seven days , depending on the accuracy of the test and the information supplied by the vendor . canadians expect us , at health canada , to ensure the accuracy and the safety of all equipment approved for use in canada . the chair : we will go back to ms. gallant . we 'll go back to ms. gallant . hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , i reject the premise of that question . in fact , the prime minister has shown fervour for all aspects of dealing with the coronavirus from the very inception of the virus on the world stage . to allege otherwise is quite disingenuous . hon . steven guilbeault : mr. chair , our government is fully committed to supporting the important and ongoing work of the auditor general , an independent officer of parliament . if the auditor general identifies the need for additional resources , we will work with the office of the auditor general to ensure that they have all the resources they need to continue fulfilling their mandate efficiently and effectively . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ( brossardsaint-lambert , lib . ) ) : there 's a point of order . mr. gabriel ste-marie ( joliette , bq ) : thank you , madamchair . first , i would like to take this opportunity to say hi from portugal . i would also like to inform you that i will be sharing my time with my colleague and friend , the member for lac-saint-jean . obrigado . while quebec estimates its additional health care costs related to covid-19 at $ 3billion , ottawa is transferring around $ 115million , which is not even4 % . does the government recognize that this is clearly insufficient ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : madamchair , the minister says that this is a substantial transfer . yes , it is a lot of money . the government is giving about $ 115million to quebec , but that is not even 4 % of what is being requested . does the minister recognize that much more is needed ? hon . patty hajdu : we have been working with the provinces and territories from the beginning to respond to the crisis . we have increased health care transfers , provided medical protective equipment and responded to all requests for assistance . we have been able to make so much progress in the fight against covid-19 precisely because of this co-operation . stirring up an imaginary quarrel between the federal government and quebec mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : this is n't the time to play cat-and-mouse . the only thing we have to do is to give the government of quebec what it 's asking for . quebec pays 23 % of the army 's budget , so quebeckers are entitled to this support . quebec has more than 5,000deaths from covid-19 , 90 % of which have been in seniors ' residences or long-term care homes . the military 's presence is vital because they play an extraordinary and essential role . will the minister commit to extending the mission now and putting an end to this uncertainty ? it 's certainly bad for both the military and the health care workers , who rely on this support . the acting chair ( mrs. alexandra mends ) : the hon . minister has 10seconds . hon . marc garneau : madamchair , in all cases similar to mr.gauthier 's , the government of canada , through its consular services , tries to do the best it can under the circumstances . this file is still active . hon . carla qualtrough : no , madamchair , that 's absolutely not the case . of course , we understand that people who are no longer receiving ei benefits should have access to the cerb . we have committed to extending the emergency sickness benefit to 26weeks . we 're working with everyone here to make that happen . we 're taking into account the needs and circumstances of all citizens in our efforts to help canadians . we know that there are many situations of canadians who are about to or are just going on maternity or parental benefits who might not have access to their ei benefits due to not having accumulated enough time for covid reasons . we 're working very hard to make sure , as we did for fish harvesters , that we support all canadians in these situations . i look forward to advising canadians of our approach on this very soon . mr. colin carrie : madame chair , the website says , to protect the health and safety of the public , offenders , parole board ... members and staff in response to the covid-19 pandemic , the pbc is currently conducting its hearings remotely via video conference or teleconference . however , when referring to victim participation , the pbc says it has implemented technological and procedural enhancements in order to provide victims ... the ability to participate ... via telephone . if video conference is an option for staff and inmates , why is it not for victims ? then , madam chair , why did the minister and this government tell canadians and the house that victims of crime have the opportunity to participate in parole hearings by video conference , when in fact they do not ? ms. elizabeth may : much worse than part 3 , from our point of view , is the treatment of people who are at this point potentially to be jailed for refusing to return to work when it 's considered reasonable and they are recipients of cerb . i wonder about the reasonableness here . it 's a subjective test . this is a wrong-headed approach to go after people and threaten them . the retroactive section has already made the canadian civil liberties association question its constitutionality . to the minister , what 's reasonable , and in whose eyes is it reasonable ? in today 's news , hamilton 's chief medical officer says there is a spike in cases among young people , who likely were exposed while taking public transit to get to work . their commute was n't safe . who determines reasonableness in deciding it 's not safe to go back to work ? mr. randall garrison : the government knows i 've been calling on friends , family and allies of the gay community to donate blood this week in the place of those of us who can not . not only do we need routine blood donations , but to do the research we need on possible prevention and treatment of covid-19 , we urgently need plasma donations from those who have recovered . this ban means that plasma donations are being rejected for no good scientific reason . again , when will the minister of health act to get this ban lifted ? mr. maxime blanchette-joncas ( rimouski-neigettetmiscouatales basques , bq ) : madamchair , i will share my time with the honourable member for longueuilsaint-hubert . as quebec starts to gradually emerge from the general lockdown , the outlook for the recovery of the tourism industry remains bleak . the economy of several regions of quebec depends on tourism to ensure stability and balance , which will be beneficial in the coming months . is the minister of finance prepared to extend the canada emergency response benefit beyond 16weeks to ensure a living wage for tourism workers ? mr. maxime blanchette-joncas : we read that the government wants to gradually replace the canada emergency response benefit by using the canada emergency wage subsidy . that 's all well and good , but seasonal industries are n't entitled to it under the current criteria . if the minister is aware of the importance of the tourism industry in the economic cycle of our regions , he must commit to helping workers . if the clientele is n't there , the industry will simply no longer exist . we still need the canada emergency response benefit . we simply need to make it an employment incentive so as not to hurt people who are lucky enough to be able to go back to work . the question is simple : will the government commit to renewing it ? mr. denis trudel : in my riding , a nice little restaurant called crpe caf on st-charles street in longueuil has just closed its doors . it 's final ; it wo n't reopen . another restaurant owner told me that he was going to reopen his restaurant , but he did n't know at what capacity . would it be at 15 % , 30 % , 40 % ? no one knows . the speed at which the economy will recover is the big unknown . how many hours a week will it be able to offer its employees ? will it be 12hours , 15hours , 22hours ? will employees even want to return to work to put in 12hours a week ? if the cerb is n't adjusted , nothing will happen . will the government commit to extending the cerb and providing an employment incentive to get the economy moving again at full speed ? </s>

<s> summarize the meeting </s> grad b : could i hit hit f - seven to do that ? on the robert ? so , we were ah ! ok . introduce . grad c : yeah , um well , `` the search for the middle layer `` . it 's basically uh talks about uh it just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , grad a : ok . continue . grad b : well i can do that , but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up grad d : nice coinage . grad c : no . we have a separate grad b : they 're separate things . grad c : you like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something . grad d : so `` nice walls `` is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh significant grad c : architecturally appealing from the outside . grad b : right ? and be able to yeah , versus , like , i was at this place in europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something . grad d : ok . so that count as counts as a nice wall . they 're not mutually exclusive ? grad b : ok , so our initial idea was not very satisfying , because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . uh . grad d : so , a big flat structure . grad b : uh . so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some like , the someone s the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like `` i 'm `` the the abstract idea being `` i am a tourist i want to go to this place . `` right ? so we 're gon na set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot . and then we have the means that they should use . right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . or yes , we could things we could n't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . yes , good . so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c : want to do vista , grad d : yeah . simple . grad b : right . um why do n't you mention things about this , bhaskara , that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now . grad c : ok , so yeah , so note the four nodes down there , the sort of , the things that are not directly extracted . actually , the five things . the `` closed `` is also not directly extracted i guess , from the uh grad b : it 's so it sort of is grad c : right , so f right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . grad b : yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here . grad c : yeah . so we have n't uh , managed like we do n't have nodes for `` discourse `` and `` parse `` , although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net . but uh the idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we do n't actually have a node for the entire parse , grad d : so some of the the top row of things what 's what 's `` disc admission fee `` ? grad c : whether they discuss the admission fees . so we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like `` can i get to this place ? `` `` what is the admission fee ? `` . so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , grad d : i see . grad b : there were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but you know , we did n't have that was the initial one that we found . grad a : yeah . they 're they 're are a couple of more things . i mean uh . i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh , agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes we grad b : yeah , th ok . so one thing i i 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the `` admission fee `` thing set up . so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this , uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , that 's how we have it currently set up , grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . grad d : ok . so that 's given in their input . so final dest so it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist , ok . so then you just have some probabilities over grad c : um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . yeah , anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node . which things ? grad a : well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ? grad b : i want to get to the church quickly , grad d : mm - hmm . um . ok . grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? grad c : we can do a little demo . grad b : oh the yeah , we could . but the demo does n't work very well . grad a : no , then it would n't be a demo i was just gon na s grad b : observe nodes . grad c : so we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . just uh i do n't know , say they discussed the admission fee yeah , no wait . that that does n't uh it 's not really consistent . they do n't discuss the admission fee . make that false . grad b : one thing that bugs me about javabayes is you have to click that and do this . ok . so let 's see . i want to query , right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . grad c : right . we were like `` hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , fifty per `` like , you know . so obviously that 's gon na happen . it 's so we have to like fit the probabilities . grad d : so , the real case ? grad b : we would actually i guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , no , i think we should have uh exponentially more middle nodes than features we 've extracted . i 'm ju i 'm just jo grad d : so . are `` doing business `` versus `` tourist `` they refer to your current task . like like current thing you want to do at this moment . ok . oh , i see , you may have a task . wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . ok . so the `` tourists `` node should be um , very consistent with the context node . right ? if you say that 's more their in general what their background is . are you assuming that or not ? like is that to be i mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . grad a : we - what set the they set the context to `` unknown `` ? grad c : right now we have n't observed it , so i guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . well no , because we th - the way we set the probabilities might not have yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? like grad b : we were th grad c : another node on what ? grad a : yeah ? uh , a statue or um grad c : so you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . grad b : it seems like in practice . grad a : so , the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel . it 's the hotel zum ritter , which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war , blah - blah - blah . it has wonderful walls . um - and lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth , grad c : what would it , uh , connect to ? like , what would , uh , it affect ? grad a : um , i think , um , it might affect oh actually it 's it it would n't affect any of our nodes , right ? grad c : well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . has it become all point fives or not ? grad b : let 's see . so this is `` has door `` uh , true , false . that 's acceptable . and i want to edit the function going to that , right ? oh no . grad c : this business . grad a : ok , so just dis dismiss everything . close it and and load up the old state so it does n't screw screw that up . grad d : um , uh , we can ask someone . grad c : like , we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of ok . yeah , s i guess he 'd be the person . grad b : no it does n't , actually . a lot of them were like , you know . grad a : or do you actually never have to write any code there ? grad b : the - there is one . i do n't know if this uses it . it just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of actually we could write a program that could generate this . grad a : do you have the true source files or just the class ? grad c : i do n't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . that might be a bit complicated . grad d : the d the data tables . grad a : but if th if there is an xml file that or format that it can also read i mean it just reads this , right ? when it starts . grad b : yeah i know there is an i was looking on the we web page and he 's updated it for an xml version of i guess bayes - nets . there 's a bayes - net spec for in xml . grad c : the javabayes guy ? so but , e he does n't use it . so in what sense has he updated it ? grad b : to my understanding . grad a : so you got more slides ? grad b : uh that 's future future work . i know what i like about these meetings is one person will nod , and then the next person will nod , and then it just goes all the way around the room . grad a : mm - hmm . i think we i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . and um let 's make those four . and maybe there are two um so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe . so things that point towards grad b : `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` exactly . that would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that . grad a : so `` pay a visit `` grad d : i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . i mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it . grad a : exactly . yeah ? and then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route um , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that where you want to pass it . hmm ? is that it ? however these are of course then the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . so this again points to `` final destination `` , `` doing business `` , `` tourist hurry `` and so forth . yeah ? and so then we can say , `` ok . we have a whole region `` in a e so e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . it 's going to get very ugly . but with this way we could say `` ok , these are the discourse phenomena . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and so forth and so forth . then we have context . grad b : one thing that 's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad a : or or any good old pink floyd concert . grad b : i see . if you want to see `` the magic flute `` or something . the spagos of heidelberg . oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . grad d : so i do n't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . grad a : so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but um { comment } um we can sort of it has a very clear interface . we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question . how deep do we want to sear , you know ? um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to adam and eve . you know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway . you know ? and it it 's fifty steps , huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ? and it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than `` new york `` , huh ? inferring everything from the context . so , works . um , even though there is probably no train from here to new york , right ? grad b : but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort . grad d : i think it has to exist somewhere . grad a : huh ? it 's not maybe reality . grad d : it 's not like german trains . like german trains are really great so . grad a : you know , on boston new york , and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , grad b : the features , grad c : evidence nodes ? grad b : i do n't know , whatever you grad a : maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh , uh and uh middle layer for those . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . grad c : yeah , this is totally like the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . we need to look at all of them . i mean but , they 're even like i mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc . grad d : it 's a even distribution . like , whatever . grad c : right ? cuz if it 's like , uh if it 's four things coming in , right ? and , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . so you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . maybe we can ask him about it . but . ok . but once you start sart start smartkom you can be on you do n't have to be on a network anymore . is that the deal ? grad b : why does smartkom need a network ? grad a : and i do n't have an ip address , they ca n't look up they do n't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth . always fun . but it 's a , um , simple solution . we can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this , but maybe not today . the other thing um i will oh yeah , ok , i have to report um , data collection . we interviewed fey , she 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . so that looks good . jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . and i talked to liz about this and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . grad c : so who would be the subject of this trial run ? grad a : if we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in . grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . yeah . i mean that 's what we wan na check , right ? grad d : well , in this case it 's a p it 's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . grad a : yes w we we would like to test the wizard , but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic grad d : i 'm sure if we uh , you think there 's a chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? i 'm sure we can get other people around who do n't know anything um , if we want another subject . you know . like i can drag ben into it or something . although he might cause problems but . so , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection totally ready determined ? grad a : um i think it 's it 's it 's i mean experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st i think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : ok . so the ideal task um , will have whatever i do n't know how much the structure of the evolving bayes - net will af affect like we wan na we wan na be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , right ? in the course of the task ? well not all of them but you know . grad a : bu - e e e i 'm even this this tango , enter , vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario . the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . the data we get from munich is very command line , simple linguistic stuff . and we actually did not want to constrain it too much , you know ? just see what people say . and then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with . um . so this this this is a parallel track , you know , there they hopefully meet , or see it or something . so that we can label it . i mean , that 's how we get a corpus that we can label . that was that . </s>
<s> what did grad b say about the structure of the belief net ? </s> grad d : i 'm sorry i grad b : uh i 'll also get rid of this `` click to add notes `` . ok . grad d : perfect . grad b : so then the features we decided or we decided we were talked about , right ? uh the the prosody , the discourse , verb choice . you know . we had a list of things like `` to go `` and `` to visit `` and what not . the `` landmark - iness `` of uh i knew you 'd like that . thank you . uh , of a of a building . whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but i decided to put it on the same line for space . `` nice walls `` which we can look up because i mean if you 're gon na get real close to a building in the tango mode , right , there 's got ta be a reason for it . and it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wan na look at the walls . the context , which in this case we 've limited to `` business person `` , `` tourist `` , or `` unknown `` , the time of day , and `` open to suggestions `` , is n't actually a feature . it 's `` we are open to suggestions . `` grad d : right . can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh , in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with grad b : oh they 're separate things . grad d : their being nice w grad b : yeah . i either could put `` nice walls `` on its own line or `` open to suggestions `` off the slide . grad d : and and by `` nice `` you mean grad c : architecturally appealing from the outside . grad d : the ok . right . something you want to inspect at close range because it 's interesting . grad a : well there there is a term that 's often used . that 's `` saliency `` , or the `` salience `` of an object . and i was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as `` landmark - iness `` . but it 's really not . i mean an object can be very salient grad b : ok , so our initial idea was not very satisfying , because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . uh . uh . so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ?

so we 're gon na set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot . and then we have the means that they should use . right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . or yes , we could things we could n't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . yes , good . so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c : want to do vista , grad b : right . grad c : right ? because if you want to view things you would n't be in a hurry . grad b : or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : whether the destination was their final destination , whether the destination was closed . those are all and then `` let 's look at the belief - net `` { comment } ok . so that means that i should switch to the other program . um right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it , because we did n't know the probabilities of or well i 'll talk about it when i get the picture up . grad a : no one knows it . grad b : ok . so this right what we let 's see . what happens if i maximize this ? there we go . but uh so . the mode basically has three different outputs . the probability whether the probability of a vista , tango , or enter . um the `` context `` , we simplified . basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . `` verb used `` is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's it 's just whether the verb is a tango verb , an enter verb , or a vista verb . grad c : yeah , that one needs a lot of grad d : and are those mutually exclusive sets ? grad c : not at all . that 's that that needs a lot of work . grad d : right . grad c : but uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , grad d : got it . uh - huh . grad b : right . um why do n't you mention things about this , bhaskara , that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now . it 's so it sort of is because it 's because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed . yeah , th ok . so one thing i i 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the `` admission fee `` thing set up . so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this , uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , grad a : mm - hmm . grad b : right ? versus pointing to just at `` tourist `` , grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : mm - hmm . why is the landmark ok . the landmark is facing to the tourists . that 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . grad d : but you can imagine that it 's verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you like it 's a conjunction of , i do n't know , you know , the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . grad d : so . uh - huh . grad c : um . well , yeah , i guess . yeah , it is . so the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then `` unknown `` as an actual value . what 's common is you just like do n't observe the variable , grad b : uh , well it depends on how many things it 's linked to . grad a : y y if if you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . grad b : right . grad a : and then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel . how about hotels ? so , the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel . it 's the hotel zum ritter , which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war , blah - blah - blah . grad b : hmm . does it have nice walls ? grad a : so . but , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say . but . um . so s so if you are a d well it 's very tricky . so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . huh . ok . let let 's do a can we add , just so i can see how it 's done , uh , a `` has door `` property or ? grad c : what would it , uh , connect to ? like , what would , uh , it affect ? grad a : um , i think , um , it might affect oh actually it 's it it would n't affect any of our nodes , right ? grad c : what i was thinking was if you had a like grad b : you could affect theoretically you could affect `` doing business `` with `` has door `` . grad c : yeah . ok . grad b : right . it was fine . grad d : so a more general thing than `` discussed admission fee `` um , could be i i 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be i do n't know , if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh , i do n't know if that might be grad a : mm - hmm . i think we grad d : uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up . grad a : i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . grad d : mm - hmm . right . grad a : and um let 's make those four . and maybe there are two um so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe . so things that point towards grad b : so instead of single node , for like , if they said the word `` admission fee `` `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` or you know something , other cues . grad a : so `` pay a visit `` grad d : mm - hmm . i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . i mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it . grad a : exactly . yeah ? and then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route um , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that where you want to pass it . hmm ? is that it ? however these are of course then the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . so this again points to `` final destination `` , `` doing business `` , `` tourist hurry `` and so forth . grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : yeah ? and so then we can say , `` ok . we have a whole region `` in a e grad d : that 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . grad a : so e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . it 's going to get very ugly . but with this way we could say `` ok , these are the discourse phenomena . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and so forth and so forth . then we have context . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : one thing that 's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . for instance if the discourse does grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad a : yeah . and if it if you do it if you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like `` so how much has it cost to enter ? `` and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars , and then the persons says um `` yeah i want to see it . `` yeah ? meaning `` it 's way out of my budget `` um grad b : i see . if you want to see `` the magic flute `` or something . oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . right . grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : so i do n't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : yeah . { comment } yeah . grad d : i mean . grad b : what sort of discourse processing is uh are the how much is built into smartkom and grad a : it works like this . the uh , um i mean . the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t they tried to figure out the intention , right ? simply by parsing it . and this um m wo n't differentiate between all modes , yeah ? but at least it 'll tell us `` ok here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . it 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . it helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , so , um , because you say `` ok , how can i get to the castle ? `` oh , how how much is it ? `` and um `` yeah i would like uh um to g let 's do it `` and so forth . so even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . grad b : mm - hmm . grad a : because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened . so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , so as in `` no i really do n't want to see that movie . i 'd rather stay home and watch tv `` um what movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , yeah , that 's what it 's called . and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . so a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but um { comment } um we can sort of it has a very clear interface . we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question . how deep do we want to sear , you know ? um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to adam and eve . you know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway . grad d : so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have . like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following ok . this person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business . um , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . um , i do n't know . they 're in in non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , `` ok , wha what plans is this a consistent with ? `` and then get s some more information and then you see `` here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into `` . it it might be useful here too . grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : i i do n't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . grad a : i mean the u u it 's in the these these these plan schemas . i mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate , you know . `` what do you need need to buy a ticket ? `` grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ? and it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than `` new york `` , huh ? inferring everything from the context . so , works . um , even though there is probably no train from here to new york , right ? grad d : mmm . not direct . grad b : you 'd uh probably have to transfer in chicago . grad a : mm - hmm . but uh it 's possible . um , no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else . right ? is that t san francisco , chicago ? grad b : i think grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : mm - hmm . grad c : i i want to see what it does with uh `` landmark - iness `` . that 's grad b : it 'd help it figure it out . grad d : so by the way tha that structure that robert drew on the board was like more um , cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gon na segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we 're talking about here are more you know , we mentioned maybe if they talk about um , i do n't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . so i i do n't know if there there 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something grad a : i think that um what you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . grad d : so . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world . so , um i suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some some toy a observable `` nodes `` is that what th grad b : refined y re just refine the grad a : maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh , uh and uh middle layer for those . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . i actually wanted to show that to you guys now but um . um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a dhcp request , so it you know , my computer does not know its ip address , you know ? always fun . but it 's a , um , simple solution . we can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this , but maybe not today . the other thing um i will oh yeah , ok , i have to report um , data collection . we interviewed fey , grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : she 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . so that looks good . jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . and i talked to liz about this and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . um liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which i think might be even better than us guys . grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . grad a : yes w we we would like to test the wizard , but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic grad d : i 'm sure if we uh , you think there 's a chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? i 'm sure we can get other people around who do n't know anything um , if we want another subject . you know . like i can drag ben into it or something . although he might cause problems but . so , is it a experimental setup for the um , data collection totally ready determined ? mm - hmm . grad a : but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok . so the ideal task um , will have whatever i do n't know how much the structure of the evolving bayes - net will af affect like we wan na we wan na be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , grad a : bu - e e e i 'm even this this tango , enter , vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . the data we get from munich is very command line , simple linguistic stuff . grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : hardly anything complicated . no metaphors whatsoever . grad d : mm - hmm . grad a : not a rich language . so we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : you know ? just see what people say . and then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with . um . so this this this is a parallel track , you know , there they hopefully meet , grad d : it could it could be used for not just this task . grad a : it should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being grad d : mm - hmm . </s>
<s> what was the next step on features ? </s> grad b : ok . so , let 's see . which one of these buttons will do this for me ? aha ! ok . grad c : well grad b : ok . introduce . grad a : ok . continue . why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ? grad d : perfect . right . can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh , in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with grad b : they 're separate things . grad d : their being nice w grad b : i either could put `` nice walls `` on its own line or `` open to suggestions `` off the slide . grad d : and and by `` nice `` you mean grad b : right . right ? and be able to grad d : there 's a lot of those . grad b : right . grad d : the ok . right . grad b : right . right . right . grad d : they 're not mutually exclusive ? right . right . definitely . grad b : ok , so our initial idea was not very satisfying , because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . uh . right . uh . so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some like , the someone s the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like `` i 'm `` the the abstract idea being `` i am a tourist i want to go to this place . `` right ? so we 're gon na set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot . and then we have the means that they should use . right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . or yes , we could things we could n't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . yes , good . so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c : want to do vista , grad b : right . grad a : no one knows it . grad c : not at all . that 's that that needs a lot of work . grad d : right . grad c : but uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , grad d : got it . uh - huh . yeah . simple . grad b : it 's so it sort of is because it 's because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed . grad d : inferred from the other ones ? grad c : and the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . grad b : right . grad c : because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so . `` what is the admission fee ? `` . so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , grad b : right . that was the initial one that we found . grad d : for one of those . and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that so all of those some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things . grad b : right . grad d : right ? so that you have no distinction between those and ok . grad a : yeah . they 're they 're are a couple of more things . grad b : right ? versus pointing to just at `` tourist `` , grad a : mm - hmm . why is the landmark ok . the landmark is facing to the tourists . that 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um grad b : right . grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . grad d : ok . so that 's given in their input . grad b : right . grad c : yeah . unknown , right ? which is th which one ? grad d : ok . so then you just have some probabilities over ok . over which which of those it is . grad c : um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . well , we to do that we would add another uh value for that . and that would require s updating the probability distribution for `` mode `` as well . because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . grad a : well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ? grad d : mm - hmm . um . ok . grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? one thing that bugs me about javabayes is you have to click that and do this . grad d : yeah . that seems kind of redundant but . grad b : right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . grad c : so that is the probability that they 're entering , vista - ing or tango - ing . grad b : if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . grad c : right . we were like `` hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , grad d : right . grad b : but i 'd like to see more . not because it would expedite the probabilities , cuz it would n't . it would actually slow that down tremendously . grad c : um . well , yeah , i guess . grad d : oh , so , i thought that was directly given by the context switch . grad b : right . grad d : ok . so the `` tourists `` node should be um , very consistent with the context node . right ? if you say that 's more their in general what their background is . grad a : we - what set the they set the context to `` unknown `` ? grad b : right . grad a : and if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same , pretty much the same ? grad c : yeah , it is . so the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then `` unknown `` as an actual value . what 's common is you just like do n't observe the variable , good point . grad b : right . way does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ? whether it 's practically speaking enterable , or actually physically enterable or not ? grad a : y y if if you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . grad b : whether it 's a whether it 's a public building , and whether it 's actually has a door . grad d : right . grad b : it seems like in practice . right . grad a : and then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel . how about hotels ? so , the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel . it 's the hotel zum ritter , which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war , blah - blah - blah . so . but , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say . but . um . so s so if you are a d well it 's very tricky . so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . huh . ok . let let 's do a can we add , just so i can see how it 's done , uh , a `` has door `` property or ?

oh no . right . it was fine . grad a : what is the c code ? can w can we see that ? how do you write the code grad b : right . grad c : the javabayes guy ? so but , e he does n't use it . so in what sense has he updated it ? grad b : well th you can either you ca or you can read both . to my understanding . right . grad d : right . grad a : and this announcement was in stereo . grad b : yes . there we go . grad d : uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up . grad a : i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . and um let 's make those four . and maybe there are two um so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe . so things that point towards grad b : `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` or you know something , other cues . grad d : i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse . i mean that 's like the bigger um , version of it . grad a : exactly . yeah ?

grad b : well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enter directly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` . grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . grad b : right . grad c : so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad b : oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . grad d : yeah . you have to have some notion of not just i mean there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse grad b : right . grad d : so i do n't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . i mean . grad b : what sort of discourse processing is uh are the how much is built into smartkom and grad a : because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened . so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , so as in `` no i really do n't want to see that movie . i 'd rather stay home and watch tv `` um what movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , yeah , that 's what it 's called . and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . so a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but um { comment } um we can sort of it has a very clear interface . we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question . how deep do we want to sear , you know ? um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to adam and eve . you know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway . grad d : i i do n't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . grad a : i mean the u u you know ? and it it 's fifty steps , grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ? and it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than `` new york `` , huh ? inferring everything from the context . so , works . um , even though there is probably no train from here to new york , right ? grad d : mmm . not direct . grad b : but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort . grad a : yeah . but that 's a different issue . grad d : so i i do n't know if there there 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something grad a : and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based . grad b : refined y re just refine the grad a : maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh , uh and uh middle layer for those . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . grad d : it 's a even distribution . like , whatever . grad c : right ? cuz if it 's like , uh if it 's four things coming in , right ? and , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . so you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . grad b : right . why does smartkom need a network ? grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . yeah . i mean that 's what we wan na check , right ? grad d : well , in this case it 's a p it 's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . grad a : yes w we we would like to test the wizard , but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic grad d : yeah . that might be a little unfair . um . i 'm sure if we uh , you think there 's a chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? i 'm sure we can get other people around who do n't know anything um , if we want another subject . grad a : but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : right ? in the course of the task ? well not all of them but you know . grad a : bu - e e e i 'm even this this tango , enter , vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . the data we get from munich is very command line , simple linguistic stuff . hardly anything complicated . no metaphors whatsoever . not a rich language . so we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . it should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being </s>
<s> summarize what was said on intentionality </s> grad a : to to handle . grad b : could i hit hit f - seven to do that ? on the robert ? i well it makes it easier to do so , we were ah ! ok . so , let 's see . which one of these buttons will do this for me ? aha ! ok . grad c : well well , i mean , just to you know , because grad a : ok . continue . grad d : it 's a needless good idea . is that the idea ? grad c : can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side is n't does n't appear ? grad b : well i can do that , but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up grad c : like you could have a p you like you could have a post office with uh you know , nice murals or something . grad d : so `` nice walls `` is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh significant grad b : right ? and be able to yeah , versus , like , i was at this place in europe where they had little carvings of , like , dead people on the walls or something . grad d : the ok . right . grad a : the grad b : direct navigational grad d : they 're not mutually exclusive ? right . definitely . grad b : ok , so our initial idea was not very satisfying , because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . uh . and they would n't look pretty . so . grad c : so we decided that for the purposes of this it 'd be simpler to just have three verbs . grad d : yeah . simple . grad b : right . um why do n't you mention things about this , bhaskara , that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now . well i it 's it 's so it sort of is because it 's because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed . grad c : right , so f right , but the other ones , the final destination , the whether they 're doing business , whether they 're in a hurry , and whether they 're tourists , that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other things . and the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . grad b : yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here . grad c : because we 'd never do inference on it anyway , so . `` what is the admission fee ? `` . so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , grad b : there were there 'd be other things besides just the admission fee , but you know , we did n't have grad d : for one of those . and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that so all of those some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things . right ? so that you have no distinction between those and ok . grad b : yeah , that would be whatever building they referred to . that 's how we have it currently set up , but it could be , you know , based upon hour or dis we could discrete it des descret - ize it . grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . grad d : ok . so that 's given in their input . grad c : so right , yeah . unknown , right ? which is th which one ? grad d : ok . so then you just have some probabilities over ok . over which which of those it is . grad c : yeah . um , right . so then landmark is oh , sorry . `` verb used `` is like , right now we only have three values , but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs . um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . grad a : uh . it yeah . but all those things without question marks are also binary . right ? grad c : that 's true . yeah . ok , i see your point . well , we to do that we would add another uh value for that . because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . grad a : well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right ? the argument in a sense ? and um uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers in there because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not grad d : that would be a cue . grad a : what 's the fastest way grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? grad c : we can do a little demo . so we can , you know , set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes . grad d : yeah . that seems kind of redundant but . grad b : ok . so let 's see . i want to query , right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . grad c : right . we were like `` hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , fifty per `` like , you know . so obviously that 's gon na happen . grad a : yeah but it it grad b : that 's that 's at grad c : it 's so we have to like fit the probabilities . grad d : so , the real case ? grad a : and grad b : we would actually i guess once we look at the data more we 'll get more hidden nodes , but i 'd like to see more . not because it would expedite the probabilities , cuz it would n't . it would actually slow that down tremendously . grad d : so . are `` doing business `` versus `` tourist `` they refer to your current task . like like current thing you want to do at this moment . ok . so the `` tourists `` node should be um , very consistent with the context node . right ? if you say that 's more their in general what their background is . are you assuming that or not ? like is that to be i mean if that 's accurate then that would determine tourist node . grad c : if the context were to set one way or another , that like strongly uh um , says something about whether whether or not they 're tourists . so what 's interesting is when it 's not when it 's set to `` unknown `` . grad a : we - what set the they set the context to `` unknown `` ? grad c : right now we have n't observed it , so i guess it 's sort of averaging over all those three possibilities . grad a : and if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same , grad c : well no , because we th - the way we set the probabilities might not have yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? like grad a : pretty much the same ? grad c : yeah , it is . so the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then `` unknown `` as an actual value . what 's common is you just like do n't observe the variable , another node on what ? good point . grad b : also you know , did n't we have a size as one ? the size of the landmark . grad c : so you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? grad b : way does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though ? whether it 's practically speaking enterable , or actually physically enterable or not ? grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . cuz they grad a : let 's get this uh b clearer . s so it 's matrix between if it 's not enterable , period . grad b : but it has a door . but the thing is ok , sh explain to me why it 's necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public . or , if something it seems like it 's equivalent to say that it does n't have a door a and it it seems like in practice . grad a : so . but , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say . but . um . so s so if you are a d well it 's very tricky . so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . huh . ok . let let 's do a can we add , just so i can see how it 's done , uh , a `` has door `` property or ? grad c : what would it , uh , connect to ? like , what would , uh , it affect ? grad a : it should , um , inhibit that , grad c : yeah , i do n't know if javabayes is nice about that . it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable , you just like it just overwrites everything . but you can check . well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . has it become all point fives or not ? grad b : let 's see . so this is `` has door `` uh , true , false . that 's acceptable . and i want to edit the function going to that , right ? oh no . right . it was fine . this grad a : ok , so just dis dismiss everything . close it and and load up the old state so it does n't screw screw that up . grad c : ok . yeah , s i guess he 'd be the person . cuz yeah . grad a : what is the c code ? can w can we see that ? how do you write the code grad b : the - there is one . i do n't know if this uses it . grad c : or yeah , right . grad a : go right mouse . open with . grad c : that 's oh ! grad b : maybe it was just it just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of grad c : so theoretically you could edit that . so you 'd have to like figure out like you have to go and grad a : and that might do . grad d : yeah , it 's yeah . grad b : or grad c : or yeah . go up one ? grad a : but if th if there is an xml file that or format that it can also read i mean it just reads this , right ? when it starts . grad c : the javabayes guy ? so but , e he does n't use it . so in what sense has he updated it ? grad b : well th you can either you ca or you can read both . and of course if you have a presentation that does n't have something that does n't work at all , then you have `` what i learned `` , as a slide . grad a : mm - hmm . i think we i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . yeah ? and so then we can say , `` ok . we have a whole region `` in a e so e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . it 's going to get very ugly . but with this way we could say `` ok , these are the discourse phenomena . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and so forth and so forth . then we have context . grad b : one thing that 's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enter directly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` . grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad a : or or any good old pink floyd concert . grad b : oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . grad d : yeah . you have to have some notion of not just i mean there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse grad a : huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ?

grad b : i like how we 've you guys have successfully narrowed it down . `` is one of you going to be the subject ? `` is one of you jump in . grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . yeah . i mean that 's what we wan na check , right ?

<s> how would the middle layer work ? </s> grad b : so , we were ah ! ok . introduce . grad c : yeah , um well , `` the search for the middle layer `` . it 's basically uh talks about uh it just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were , grad a : ok . continue . grad d : it 's a needless good idea . is that the idea ? grad b : and then if i do that it 'll mess everything up . grad d : i was wondering . and and by `` nice `` you mean grad b : right . grad d : so `` nice walls `` is a stand in for like architecturally it , uh significant grad c : architecturally appealing from the outside . grad b : right ? and be able to grad d : ok . so that count as counts as a nice wall . grad a : well there there is a term that 's often used . that 's `` saliency `` , or the `` salience `` of an object . and i was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as `` landmark - iness `` . but it 's really not . i mean an object can be very salient but not a landmark at all . grad d : not a landmark at all . there 's landmark for um , touristic reasons and landmark for i do n't know navigational reasons or something . grad b : right . right . right . grad d : right ? they 're not mutually exclusive ? right . definitely . so , a big flat structure . grad b : right . grad d : right ? grad b : right . um why do n't you mention things about this , bhaskara , that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now . because it 's because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed . grad c : and the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . grad b : yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here . grad c : but uh the idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we do n't actually have a node for the entire parse , grad b : right . grad d : so some of the the top row of things what 's what 's `` disc admission fee `` ?

grad c : well no , because we th - the way we set the probabilities might not have yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? like grad a : pretty much the same ? grad c : but uh i do n't know y what the right thing is to do for that . i 'm not i do n't know if i totally am happy with the way it is . another node on what ? good point . grad b : right . grad a : so maybe we wan na have `` landmark `` meaning now `` enterable landmark `` versus , um something that 's simply just a vista point , for example . grad c : so you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered ? grad a : yeah , exactly . grad d : right . grad a : and then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel . how about hotels ? grad c : what would it , uh , connect to ? like , what would , uh , it affect ? right . grad a : right ? grad b : the safety net . grad c : well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . has it become all point fives or not ? grad b : right . it was fine . this grad a : ok , so just dis dismiss everything . close it and and load up the old state so it does n't screw screw that up . grad c : ok . yeah , s i guess he 'd be the person . grad a : what is the c code ? can w can we see that ? how do you write the code grad b : the - there is one . i do n't know if this uses it . you know how they get `` auto - fills `` i guess , grad c : yeah . that 's how actual probability tables are specified . so theoretically you could edit that . so you 'd have to like figure out like you have to go and grad b : actually we could write a program that could generate this . grad a : and that might do . grad b : i do n't know if he actually grad c : yeah . uh , yeah . we do i do n't know if it actually manipulate the source , though . that might be a bit complicated . grad b : right . well th you can either you ca or you can read both . to my understanding . grad c : ok . that would be awesome . grad b : right . grad d : right . grad a : so the uh i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . grad b : `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` grad d : right ? what do you mean by that ? grad b : well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of `` enter directly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` . grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad b : really ? grad a : or or any good old pink floyd concert . grad b : i see . if you want to see `` the magic flute `` or something . grad a : i think that the h i mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in japan . so there , two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque . you know . then again , everything else is free then once you 're ins in there . grad c : really . grad a : you know ? because it 's just too expensive . grad b : oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort . yeah but i do n't know if it 's still grad a : well it never went all the way , right ? i mean you always had to change trains at omaha , grad d : uh . mm - hmm . yeah . grad c : really ? grad a : huh ? it 's not maybe reality . but you know , i do n't know whether it 's which ones are safer , you know , statistically . you know , on boston new york , and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , for the uh nodes that are observable ? the `` outer layer `` ? maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh , uh and uh middle layer for those . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . grad c : yeah , this is totally like the probabilities and all are completely ad - hoc . we need to look at all of them . i mean but , they 're even like i mean like , close to the end we were like , uh , you know we were like uh really ad - hoc . grad d : that 's uh well grad a : and if i reboot without a network , i will not be able to start smartkom , because i need to have a network . grad b : why does smartkom need a network ? grad a : um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a dhcp request , so it you know , my computer does not know its ip address , you know ? grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . yeah . i mean that 's what we wan na check , right ? is n't that what it is ? i guess that would be reasonable . grad a : you know , set up as grad b : yeah . i know . that 's probably a good enough test of grad d : yeah . that might be a little unfair . um . grad a : um i think it 's it 's it 's i mean experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st i think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : mm - hmm . exactly . grad a : that was that . grad c : so what 's `` economics , the fallacy `` ? grad a : maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue . </s>
<s> what was the importance of smartkom ? </s> grad c : well grad d : i 'm sorry i it 's a needless good idea . is that the idea ? grad b : uh i 'll also get rid of this `` click to add notes `` . ok . grad d : perfect . grad b : thank you . uh , of a of a building . whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but i decided to put it on the same line for space . `` nice walls `` which we can look up because i mean if you 're gon na get real close to a building in the tango mode , right , there 's got ta be a reason for it . and it 's either because you 're in route to something else or you wan na look at the walls . the context , which in this case we 've limited to `` business person `` , `` tourist `` , or `` unknown `` , the time of day , and `` open to suggestions `` , is n't actually a feature . it 's `` we are open to suggestions . `` grad d : right . can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh , in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmark - iness cor is correlated with grad b : oh they 're separate things . yeah . i either could put `` nice walls `` on its own line or `` open to suggestions `` off the slide . grad d : and and by `` nice `` you mean ok . so that count as counts as a nice wall . something you want to inspect at close range because it 's interesting . grad a : well there there is a term that 's often used . that 's `` saliency `` , or the `` salience `` of an object . and i was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as `` landmark - iness `` . but it 's really not . i mean an object can be very salient but not a landmark at all . grad d : they 're not mutually exclusive ? grad b : uh . so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some like , the someone s the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like `` i 'm `` the the abstract idea being `` i am a tourist i want to go to this place . `` right ? so we 're gon na set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they 've said previously and whatnot . and then we have the means that they should use . right ? but the middle thing , we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out , like , the concept of whether they 're a tourist or whether they 're running an errand or something like that along those lines . or yes , we could things we could n't extract the from the data , the hidden variables . yes , good . so then the hidden variables hair variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry , because we were thinking uh , if they were in a hurry there 'd be less likely to like or th grad c : want to do vista , grad b : right . or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a like a navigational point to go to another place . grad d : mm - hmm . grad b : whether the destination was their final destination , whether the destination was closed . those are all and then `` let 's look at the belief - net `` { comment } ok . so that means that i should switch to the other program . um right now it 's still kind of in a toy version of it , because we did n't know the probabilities of or well i 'll talk about it when i get the picture up . grad a : no one knows it . grad b : ok . so this right what we let 's see . what happens if i maximize this ? there we go . but uh so . the mode basically has three different outputs . the probability whether the probability of a vista , tango , or enter . um the `` context `` , we simplified . basically it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown . `` verb used `` is actually personally amusing mainly because it 's it 's just whether the verb is a tango verb , an enter verb , or a vista verb . grad c : yeah , that one needs a lot of not at all . that 's that that needs a lot of work . grad d : right . grad c : but uh that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter , grad d : got it . uh - huh . grad b : right . um why do n't you mention things about this , bhaskara , that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now . it 's so it sort of is because it 's because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed . grad c : and the mode , you know , depends on all those things only . but uh the idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we do n't actually have a node for the entire parse , `` what is the admission fee ? `` . so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , grad d : right ? so that you have no distinction between those and ok . grad b : yeah , th ok . so one thing i i 'm you know unsure about , is how we have the discus uh the `` admission fee `` thing set up . so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this , uh we kept um things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the `` admission fee `` going directly to the mode pointing at `` enter `` , right ? versus pointing to just at `` tourist `` , right . grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . grad d : ok . so then you just have some probabilities over grad c : um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . well , we to do that we would add another uh value for that . and that would require s updating the probability distribution for `` mode `` as well . because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account . grad d : yeah . exactly . grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . grad c : so that is the probability that they 're entering , vista - ing or tango - ing . grad b : if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . grad d : so . uh - huh . grad c : fifty per `` like , you know . so obviously that 's gon na happen . grad b : but i 'd like to see more . not because it would expedite the probabilities , cuz it would n't . it would actually slow that down tremendously . grad c : um . well , yeah , i guess . grad a : so if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the at we - what set the they set the context to `` unknown `` ? grad c : well no , because we th - the way we set the probabilities might not have yeah , it 's it 's an it 's an issue , right ? like yeah , it is . so the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then `` unknown `` as an actual value . what 's common is you just like do n't observe the variable , but uh i do n't know y what the right thing is to do for that . i 'm not i do n't know if i totally am happy with the way it is . grad b : uh , well it depends on how many things it 's linked to . grad a : y y if if you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . grad b : right . grad a : and then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel . how about hotels ? so , the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel . it 's the hotel zum ritter , which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war , blah - blah - blah . so . but , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say . but . um . so s so if you are a d well it 's very tricky . so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . huh . ok . let let 's do a can we add , just so i can see how it 's done , uh , a `` has door `` property or ? grad c : what would it , uh , connect to ? like , what would , uh , it affect ? grad a : um , i think , um , it might affect oh actually it 's it it would n't affect any of our nodes , right ? grad c : what i was thinking was if you had a like grad b : you could affect theoretically you could affect `` doing business `` with `` has door `` . grad c : yeah . ok . grad b : right . it was fine . grad a : and that might do . grad b : well th you can either you ca or you can read both . to my understanding . grad a : so the uh and this announcement was in stereo . grad d : so a more general thing than `` discussed admission fee `` um , could be i i 'm just wondering whether the context , the background context of the discourse might be i do n't know , if there 's a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um , there might be other cues that , say , um , in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh , i do n't know if that might be grad a : mm - hmm . i think we grad d : uh , and and into that node would be various various things that that could have specifically come up . grad a : i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . and um let 's make those four . and maybe there are two um so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer . maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe . so things that point towards grad b : so instead of single node , for like , if they said the word `` admission fee `` `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` grad d : yeah . grad b : exactly . that would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that . grad a : so `` pay a visit `` grad c : yeah . grad a : exactly . yeah ? and then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route um , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that where you want to pass it . hmm ? is that it ? however these are of course then the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . so this again points to `` final destination `` , `` doing business `` , `` tourist hurry `` and so forth . yeah ? and so then we can say , `` ok . we have a whole region `` in a e grad d : that 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . grad a : and so forth and so forth . then we have context . grad c : yeah . so essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little bayes - nets of their own . grad b : one thing that 's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . grad c : that 's true . grad b : for instance if the discourse does grad d : what do you mean by that ? grad b : well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the grad d : uh - huh . grad b : or increase the probability of `` enter directly `` versus `` going there via tourist `` . grad c : yeah . or we could like add more , uh , sort of middle nodes . like we could add a node like do they want to enter it , which is affected by admission fee and by whether it 's closed and by whether it has a door . grad b : right . grad c : so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad a : yeah . and if it if you do it if you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like `` so how much has it cost to enter ? `` and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars , and then the persons says um `` yeah i want to see it . `` yeah ? meaning `` it 's way out of my budget `` um you know ? because it 's just too expensive . grad b : oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . grad d : yeah . you have to have some notion of not just i mean there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse grad b : right . grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : so i do n't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : yeah . { comment } yeah . grad d : i mean . grad b : what sort of discourse processing is uh are the how much is built into smartkom and grad a : it works like this . the uh , um i mean . the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t they tried to figure out the intention , right ? simply by parsing it . and this um m wo n't differentiate between all modes , yeah ? but at least it 'll tell us `` ok here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . it 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . it helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , so , um , because you say `` ok , how can i get to the castle ? `` oh , how how much is it ? `` and um `` yeah i would like uh um to g let 's do it `` and so forth . so even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . grad b : mm - hmm . grad a : because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened . so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before , so as in `` no i really do n't want to see that movie . i 'd rather stay home and watch tv `` um what movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model , yeah , that 's what it 's called . and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues . so a person pointing to something on the screen , you know , the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but um { comment } um we can sort of it has a very clear interface . we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question . how deep do we want to sear , you know ? um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to adam and eve . you know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway . grad d : so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have . like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following ok . this person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business . um , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . um , i do n't know . they 're in in non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , `` ok , wha what plans is this a consistent with ? `` and then get s some more information and then you see `` here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into `` . it it might be useful here too . grad a : mm - hmm . grad d : i i do n't know how you know you 'd have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that . grad a : i mean the u u it 's in the these these these plan schemas . i mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate , you know . `` what do you need need to buy a ticket ? `` grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ? and it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than `` new york `` , huh ? inferring everything from the context . so , works . um , even though there is probably no train from here to new york , right ? grad d : mmm . not direct . grad b : i think but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort . grad c : i 've done that kind of thing . grad a : yeah . but that 's a different issue . grad b : it 'd help it figure it out . grad d : just kidding . right . so by the way tha that structure that robert drew on the board was like more um , cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gon na segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we 're talking about here are more you know , we mentioned maybe if they talk about um , i do n't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . so i i do n't know if there there 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something so . mm - hmm . grad a : and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer , might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world . so , um i suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some some toy a observable `` nodes `` is that what th grad b : refined y re just refine the grad a : for the uh nodes that are observable ? the `` outer layer `` ? grad c : just observable nodes , grad a : maybe make up some features for each region and uh and uh , uh and uh middle layer for those . and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . grad d : that 's uh well grad b : right . grad a : and if i reboot without a network , i will not be able to start smartkom , because i need to have a network . grad c : but . ok . but once you start sart start smartkom you can be on you do n't have to be on a network anymore . is that the deal ? grad b : why does smartkom need a network ? grad a : um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a dhcp request , so it you know , my computer does not know its ip address , you know ? always fun . but it 's a , um , simple solution . we can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this , but maybe not today . the other thing um i will oh yeah , ok , i have to report um , data collection . we interviewed fey , um liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which i think might be even better than us guys . grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . grad d : yeah . that might be a little unfair . um . i 'm sure if we uh , you think there 's a chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? i 'm sure we can get other people around who do n't know anything um , if we want another subject . grad a : um i think it 's it 's it 's i mean experimental setup u on the technical issue yes , except we st i think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard , just a tape recorder that 's running in a room . but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : ok . so the ideal task um , will have whatever i do n't know how much the structure of the evolving bayes - net will af affect like we wan na we wan na be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that , grad a : bu - e e e i 'm even this this tango , enter , vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario . grad d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad a : the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . the data we get from munich is very command line , simple linguistic stuff . not a rich language . so we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . and we actually did not want to constrain it too much , you know ? just see what people say . and then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with . um . so this this this is a parallel track , you know , there they hopefully meet , it should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being </s>
<s> what was said about hiring ? </s> grad b : i well it makes it easier to do so , we were ah ! ok . so , let 's see . which one of these buttons will do this for me ? aha ! ok . grad c : should you go back to the first one ? well grad d : i 'm sorry i grad b : ok . introduce . grad a : ok . continue . why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ? grad b : uh i 'll also get rid of this `` click to add notes `` . ok . grad d : perfect . grad b : they 're separate things . grad d : their being nice w grad b : yeah . i either could put `` nice walls `` on its own line or `` open to suggestions `` off the slide . grad c : architecturally appealing from the outside . grad d : the ok . right . they 're not mutually exclusive ? grad b : ok , so our initial idea was not very satisfying , because uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node . uh . uh . so then our next idea was to add a middle layer , right ? so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we 've drawn from the communication of some like , the someone s the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea , like `` i 'm `` the the abstract idea being `` i am a tourist i want to go to this place . `` right ?

`` `` what is the admission fee ? `` . so that 's like a huge uh clue that they 're trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista , that was like our example . grad b : that was the initial one that we found . grad d : right ? so that you have no distinction between those and ok . grad a : i mean uh . i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh , agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes we grad b : right . navigational landmarks , grad c : yeah . normally context will include a huge amount of information , but um , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're a tourist or not , i guess . grad d : ok . so that 's given in their input . grad c : yeah . unknown , right ? um `` nice walls `` is binary , `` closed `` is binary `` final destination `` , again yeah , all those are binary i guess . and `` mode `` is one of three things . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not grad b : right . excellent . do we have anything else to say about this ? oh the yeah , we could . but the demo does n't work very well . and the time of day is night ? right ? the mode . ok , and then on here so let 's see . grad c : so that is the probability that they 're entering , vista - ing or tango - ing . grad b : if it 's night time , they have not discussed admission fee , and the n walls are nice . so , yeah . i guess that sort of makes sense . the reason i say the demo does n't work very well is yesterday we uh observed everything in favor of taking a tour , and it came up as `` tango `` , right ? over and over again . we could n't we could n't figure out how to turn it off of `` tango `` . grad c : right . we were like `` hmm , well if the person does this and this and this , let 's say forty percent for this , grad d : so , the real case ? grad c : um . well , yeah , i guess . not that much though . only a little early . grad d : so . are `` doing business `` versus `` tourist `` they refer to your current task . like like current thing you want to do at this moment . ok . oh , i see , you may have a task . wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage . ok . so the `` tourists `` node should be um , very consistent with the context node . right ? if you say that 's more their in general what their background is . grad a : we - what set the they set the context to `` unknown `` ? pretty much the same ? grad c : yeah , it is . so the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then `` unknown `` as an actual value . what 's common is you just like do n't observe the variable , good point . but i guess at some point we did . grad d : it seems like it would for uh , uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not . grad b : it seems like in practice . right . grad a : so , the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel . it 's the hotel zum ritter , which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war , blah - blah - blah . grad b : excellent . grad a : so . but , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say . but . um . so s so if you are a d well it 's very tricky . so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities , from that point of view . huh . ok . let let 's do a can we add , just so i can see how it 's done , uh , a `` has door `` property or ? grad c : ok . it 's true . well that 's fine , but we have to see the function now . has it become all point fives or not ? grad b : right . it was fine . up one . ah yes , good . grad c : the javabayes guy ? so but , e he does n't use it . so in what sense has he updated it ? grad b : to my understanding . and of course if you have a presentation that does n't have something that does n't work at all , then you have `` what i learned `` , as a slide . what i learned . ok , so i think that uh our presentation 's finished . i know what i like about these meetings is one person will nod , and then the next person will nod , and then it just goes all the way around the room . grad d : i missed my turn . grad a : and this announcement was in stereo . grad b : yes . there we go . grad a : i think a a sort of general strategy here you know , this is this is excellent because um it gets you thinking along these terms is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee , and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before . grad b : `` admission fee `` , or maybe , you know , `` how much to enter `` grad d : yeah . grad a : so `` pay a visit `` grad c : yeah . grad a : exactly . yeah ?

is that it ? however these are of course then the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer . so this again points to `` final destination `` , `` doing business `` , `` tourist hurry `` and so forth . yeah ? and so then we can say , `` ok . we have a whole region `` in a e grad d : that 's a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer . grad a : so e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing . it 's going to get very ugly . but with this way we could say `` ok , these are the discourse phenomena . they ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer . and so forth and so forth . then we have context . grad b : one thing that 's kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the i guess , the fact that the there 's a complete separation between the observed features and in the output . grad d : what do you mean by that ? grad b : well for instance , the `` discourse admission fee `` node seems like it should point directly to the right . grad c : so it 's like there are those are the two options . either like make an arrow directly or put a new node . grad b : i see . if you want to see `` the magic flute `` or something . grad c : really . grad b : oh yeah , i think i see . so the discourse refers to `` admission fee `` but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse . grad d : yeah . you have to have some notion of not just i mean there 's a there 's change across several turns of discourse grad b : right . grad d : so i do n't know how if any of this was discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh , other other discourse processing that might be happen . i mean . grad b : what sort of discourse processing is uh are the how much is built into smartkom and grad a : it works like this . the uh , um i mean . the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t they tried to figure out the intention , right ? simply by parsing it . and this um m wo n't differentiate between all modes , yeah ? but at least it 'll tell us `` ok here we have something that somebody that wants to go someplace , now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening , and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed , what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules . it 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented . it helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted , so , um , because you say `` ok , how can i get to the castle ? `` oh , how how much is it ? `` and um `` yeah i would like uh um to g let 's do it `` and so forth . so even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here . so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing but um { comment } um we can sort of it has a very clear interface . we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question . how deep do we want to sear , you know ? um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research , so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to adam and eve . you know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ? and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway . grad d : so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of `` admission fee discussion `` as a cue for entry , is thinking about the plans that various people might have . like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following ok . this person is um , finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business . um , because then anything that 's a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan . um , i do n't know . they 're in in non in sort of more traditional ai kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know , some idea at each turn of agent doing something , `` ok , wha what plans is this a consistent with ? `` and then get s some more information and then you see `` here 's a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into `` . it it might be useful here too . grad a : you know ? and it it 's fifty steps , huh ? just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter , you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those . it 's amazing what human beings can do . w when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says new york and you say track seven , huh ? and it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than `` new york `` , huh ? inferring everything from the context . so , works . um , even though there is probably no train from here to new york , right ? their reputation is very bad . grad d : let 's all say it a few more times . grad b : it 'd help it figure it out . grad d : so by the way tha that structure that robert drew on the board was like more um , cue - type - based , right , here 's like we 're gon na segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we 're talking about here are more you know , we mentioned maybe if they talk about um , i do n't know , entering or som you know like they might be more task - based . so i i do n't know if there there 's obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variables into something grad a : i think that um what you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions . might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world . so , um i suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions , and we make up some some toy a observable `` nodes `` is that what th yep . the - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come . grad d : it 's a even distribution . like , whatever . grad c : right ? cuz if it 's like , uh if it 's four things coming in , right ? and , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that . so you 're thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible things numbers to enter , yeah , the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect . grad b : right . grad a : i actually wanted to show that to you guys now but um . grad c : but . ok . but once you start sart start smartkom you can be on you do n't have to be on a network anymore . is that the deal ? grad b : why does smartkom need a network ? grad a : um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a dhcp request , so it you know , my computer does not know its ip address , you know ? and i do n't have an ip address , they ca n't look up they do n't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth . always fun . but it 's a , um , simple solution . we can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this , but maybe not today . the other thing um i will oh yeah , ok , i have to report um , data collection . we interviewed fey , she 's willing to do it , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to , but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . so that looks good . jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her , see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard . and i talked to liz about this and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data . grad c : so who would be the subject of this trial run ? grad a : um liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which i think might be even better than us guys . grad d : good . grad b : i like how we 've you guys have successfully narrowed it down . `` is one of you going to be the subject ? `` is one of you jump in . grad c : well i just figured it has to be someone who 's , um , familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard , so we can , uh , see if they 're you know good . grad d : oh plants ? e u someone who can plant difficult things . well , in this case it 's a p it 's a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject . grad c : is n't that what it is ? grad a : yes w we we would like to test the wizard , but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic grad d : i 'm sure if we uh , you think there 's a chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ? i 'm sure we can get other people around who do n't know anything um , if we want another subject . grad a : but um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further grad d : right ? in the course of the task ? well not all of them but you know . grad a : the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following . the data we get from munich is very command line , simple linguistic stuff . not a rich language . so we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language . it should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur , it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being that was that . </s>

how do i i escape this s uh presentation ? and show , sorry . okay , so let 's have a look s at this one . okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control no , that 's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a tv remote control only . so have you changed that part ? uh so so yeah , that 's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh oh it does n't matter , just start with the user interface : functional requirements , yeah marketing : okay . well my name is jens damman , but we 're in a group , and i i will start it . wait . um i 've used a marketing report on uh the site . uh i think you 've uh read it too . uh and uh f and furthermore i uh surfed the o the other site . project manager : i did n't get it uh anyway . user interface : no , i didn do n't thing we got it . marketing : oh okay , i i was the only one who get it . um martijn alr already said it . project manager : so we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . marketing : but y but you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? project manager : so it has to look uh uh uh unique , marketing : the company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . industrial designer : yeah . i think the main thing is the usability , that 's where we can uh make it a special product . user interface : but uh we also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . but we have to make sure that we 're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . so make it just a different colour or different shape , project manager : it 's on the on the uh net net uh thing , maybe i maybe it 's too complicated , industrial designer : no , neither do i . marketing : mm-hmm . user interface : when not anymore for tv . marketing : um user interface : is industrial designer : uh uh the p uh next and previous . previous i know , but next channel ? i do n't thi marketing : forward . project manager : just very simple . a ten plus or user interface : so we have a a period of , i dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and so i i do n't think so . so you have but um okay , uh now my personal preferences . uh using the standards , basic um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . so when you are in the shop and you see our tv controller hanging , that it stands out . not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . project manager : just to make it user interface : yeah . well why not ? or yeah . they they 're uh designed very well . project manager : we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we wo n't make it . user interface : well uh project manager : okay , we make it red . user interface : we do n't have to make it red . maybe integrate it in the design as well . maybe it 's it is would an e no . just uh project manager : if we can still make that then user interface : yeah . it 's it 's not very important , industrial designer : and uh the receptor in the tv senses the pattern . so we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . so that it can be used with all the tvs . we have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o on the otherwise it wo n't work . user interface : so we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh industrial designer : no . i i uh the chip um uh is producing the pattern . so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to that are working . yeah , or i dunno how it 's uh exactly how it works . it was n't explained there . user interface : and list of all the tvs you have , etcetera . and you have to put in a number , so it works on your tv . marketing : and then it 's okay . so you do n't have to search for your television or your code . it uh search uh the pattern for itself . user interface : so we use that . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but uh ma basically for uh brands of tv these patterns are different . so like when you press a one on one tv it go go to one . and on the other tv it wo n't work , basically . so uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . and uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . user interface : no i do n't think so , but yeah , i it it will look different , and i think we need to find something else . 'cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is industrial designer : yeah . there . yeah . user interface : yeah , we 're thinking about it . uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh project manager : everyone agrees with that , or okay . industrial designer : yeah . production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . marketing : bec twelve and a half , okay . but but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . user interface : but we lose about ninety percent of those options . so i think you can uh project manager : no worry . industrial designer : but um basically what we could do too is uh have a bluetooth uh integration . project manager : yeah , i just want to talk some about some more . so maybe you have to yeah ? so this oh , sorry . wh what 's that ? so uh oh , sorry . we have some new uh project requirements . we have to have a look what they are . they 're still in um uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . so a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . i 'm not sure . i do n't think so , so does it make some decision about that ? user interface : um industrial designer : that kinda changes the whole situation . user interface : well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . i think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , project manager : that still stays . user interface : so , but uh yeah . what other features can we put in ? industrial designer : i do n't know . marketing : i did n't have information about that . industrial designer : yeah , it 's probably my job to figure that out , but marketing : no , that yeah , then th we have to think about that . but do do we do it ? it 's more if we if we do it . project manager : it we have short time to to put it on the market , industrial designer : yeah , i dunno . project manager : so that we have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . user interface : mm yeah well industrial designer : yeah , i think so . marketing : in uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . uh because we we have a lot of languages . industrial designer : but hmm yeah , tv one . user interface : well i dunno . but i do n't think , it just ai n't useful enough . project manager : we have to make some decisions . so you can see on the uh so we have to know what we 're going to put on . do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? do okay , we just take that one . and what else , we have marketing : so if you user interface : okay yeah . d yeah , alright . yeah . project manager : so y you just make it th through you look through it ? yeah . for me too , it is . so we just keep it one level then ? okay . okay . so that 's it for toda for we 're going to have a lunch lunch break . um so yeah , you know what you have to do . this is uh this is it . you get your meal and everything , so so , we 're finished for t for this time . we 're going to have some lunch . industrial designer : yeah . </s>
<s> summarize the presentation and discussion on functional requirements . </s> user interface : uh let 's see . which one was mine ? project manager : that we know what we 're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . uh first i have the notes of the last meeting , so i showed uh show them to you . oh , sorry about that , i just escape this one . how do i escape this ? how do i i escape this s uh presentation ? user interface : uh left . project manager : ah okay . and show , sorry . okay , so let 's have a look s at this one . okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control no , that 's i uh s i just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a tv remote control only . so have you changed that part ? marketing : okay . project manager : um so yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . it 's it 's still the same . um all these points uh we have to look at . you all know them . but uh there 's another point . the um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . so they 're old and not younger people . so we have to look at that as well . 'specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , i dunno . user interface : yeah , okay . project manager : uh so so yeah , that 's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh marketing : okay . well my name is jens damman , but we 're in a group , and i i will start it . wait . um i 've used a marketing report on uh the site . uh i think you 've uh read it too . uh and uh f and furthermore i uh surfed the o the other site . user interface : no , i didn do n't thing we got it . marketing : oh okay , i i was the only one who get it . okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . and uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . so i um i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . so we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . yeah , i think uh uh that 's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . i think this fits uh at the uh what what uh michael said about uh older people . older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what 's good . because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . well okay , that 's uh normal . i think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . but that 's one of our requirements . project manager : the last point is quite an interesting marketing : yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . um martijn alr already said it . project manager : if we yeah . marketing : and uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but i do n't think it 's uh project manager : yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , marketing : reachable . yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : that that 's a good one . um uh page two . remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . that 's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . uh i thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . uh you must find it uh quickly . user interface : uh . maybe just a button on the home station . so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . marketing : okay , yeah . yeah , we can uh combine that . uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . uh i think we must t uh take a look at this . it 's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . but it 's uh a tough one . because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty i think . uh next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours tv or something . i do n't we we have n't uh we must n't look too much at uh the last point . okay , last page . project manager : marketing : uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . we did n't uh think about that already . and uh an lcd on the remote control . we already thought about that . um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . and but they 're more critical . and older people uh want to spend uh more money . but uh they uh they do n't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they 're in their old uh thinking way . and they want to keep the old uh things the old things . project manager : so we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . marketing : but y but you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? project manager : people . so yeah , so we just can skip the lcd r on the remote control , marketing : i i think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , project manager : because yeah . marketing : because it 's not reachable for twenty five euros . project manager : it 's too okay . marketing : um then i have my personal uh preference . okay , that 's not very good , because i thought about television , d_v_d_ player , stereo and v_c_r_ . i had a question about . but it 's already out of the question , this . um my point is , well , i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , i think it 's hard to uh sell it for twenty five euros . but it 's the exercise . yeah , only only for television uh on the market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control for everything . and we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . okay , i told about the home station . uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . and i i found a motto . and we put the fashion in electronics . and that 's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . we we have to make a a new product . we have to be um yeah . one of a kind , i think . project manager : so it has to look uh uh uh unique , marketing : okay , this was uh my presentation . user interface : okay . yeah well uh . project manager : it 's on the on the uh net net uh thing , user interface : okay . technical functions design . okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . is n't that is n't true anymore . but um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . not too full , like uh jens already said , only ten percent is being used . project manager : so what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or user interface : but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does . so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control to find out . but there is already in a one done . of functions i could think of . uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . just one two three etcetera . uh text service options . um basic on-off . and i found an uh could i think of favourites ? i always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . but if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your project manager : maybe i maybe it 's too complicated , it 's a good idea , but user interface : it 's it was just a thought . so i 'm , i u i would find it handy , i think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . industrial designer : yeah , okay . but um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? user interface : oh are you ? project manager : if i do n't do it , maybe old people and how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? user interface : to just keep it simple and standard uh features . so we have a a period of , i dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and uh i just thought of another one . okay , uh now my personal preferences . uh using the standards , basic um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . so when you are in the shop and you see our tv controller hanging , that it stands out . not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . project manager : yeah . does it have to be uh it has to be uh with different colours it 's like a imac or something . just to make it user interface : yeah . well why not ? or yeah . marketing : that 's fa that 's fancy . that 's uh fashion . project manager : but it looks cheap as well , because it 's a small thing . it 's only twenty five euros . it looks very cheap if you make it oh , you just i dunno what happened . user interface : yeah , i i 'm finished . i think we discussed everything . industrial designer : okay . well , the working design . the method i used is uh search the web . just the web page provided . um basically i 'm i 'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh i could figure it out . um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . and by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . so like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh then the chip produces a pattern . like a morse code to uh and and sends that to the uh l_e_d_ . that 's the uh light emitting diode , i think . um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . that 's un uh invisible to the human eye . and uh transmit that uh to the tv . however it has also an uh a visible uh diode that 's uh blinking red if you look in it . and that 's uh another diode , i believe . but yeah . i i think so . user interface : uh j is industrial designer : i i 'm not sure if it 's the same thing . project manager : yeah , it 's i think it 's usable . marketing : yeah , that 's active . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so project manager : you have to the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . uh that 's cool . if we can still make that then marketing : industrial designer : user interface : yeah . it 's it 's not very important , industrial designer : and uh the receptor in the tv senses the pattern . so we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . so that it can be used with all the tvs . we have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o on the otherwise it wo n't work . user interface : so we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh industrial designer : but uh ma basically for uh brands of tv these patterns are different . so like when you press a one on one tv it go go to one . and on the other tv it wo n't work , basically . so uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . okay . well uh the components . marketing : industrial designer : um that 's connecting to all the components . project manager : user interface : uh i th project manager : so this oh , sorry . wh what 's that ? so uh oh , sorry . we have some new uh project requirements . we have to have a look what they are . they 're still in um uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . so a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . i 'm not sure . i do n't think so , industrial designer : and i i think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . project manager : yeah , that 's uh what i told you . the remote control should only be used for a television . so that 's maybe easier . and um the the forty plus people , i already told you . oh no , sorry . oh , this is a problem . oh sorry about that . the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . so it should be flashy or just more interesting . marketing : okay . user interface : okay , that 's it changes things . project manager : i 'm sorry about that . i just i just did n't read it well . marketing : user interface : to make it more like a mobile phone . more modern . yeah , i tho i think that 's not usable . so , but uh yeah . what other features can we put in ? industrial designer : yeah . i think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . and uh then the usability is not that required , because the like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good i think . marketing : but uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . about you said one and the television turns on one . is that reachable maybe ? that 's very that 's fancy . that 's cool . user interface : i d yeah . i do n't think it 's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . marketing : okay , no speech recognition . project manager : okay , we just take that one . user interface : also the one in the dark . so uh it lights up when it 's dark ?

<s> why did marketing suggest giving up on speech recognition when presenting the functional requirements ? </s> project manager : that we know what we 're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . uh first i have the notes of the last meeting , so i showed uh show them to you . oh , sorry about that , i just escape this one . how do i escape this ? how do i i escape this s uh presentation ? industrial designer : just yeah . marketing : user interface : okay . marketing : okay . project manager : um so yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . it 's it 's still the same . um all these points uh we have to look at . you all know them . but uh there 's another point . the um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . so they 're old and not younger people . so we have to look at that as well .

project manager : people . so yeah , so we just can skip the lcd r on the remote control , user interface : yeah . project manager : because yeah . marketing : because it 's not reachable for twenty five euros . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : um then i have my personal uh preference . okay , that 's not very good , because i thought about television , d_v_d_ player , stereo and v_c_r_ . i had a question about . but it 's already out of the question , this . um my point is , well , i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , i think it 's hard to uh sell it for twenty five euros . but it 's the exercise . project manager : because it 's too expensive . yeah , probably . marketing : yeah , only only for television uh on the market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control for everything . and we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . project manager : so it has to look uh uh uh unique , but old people are not looking for that . user interface : 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . but we have to make sure that we 're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . so make it just a different colour or different shape , project manager : yeah . okay . user interface : okay . yeah well uh . okay . technical functions design . okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . is n't that is n't true anymore . but um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . not too full , like uh jens already said , only ten percent is being used . project manager : so what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or okay . user interface : but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does . so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control project manager : okay . maybe i maybe it 's too complicated , it 's a good idea , but user interface : it 's it was just a thought . so i 'm , i u i would find it handy , i think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . project manager : if i do n't do it , maybe old people user interface : they do n't like new features . so maybe not . when not anymore for tv . project manager : i know what it is , but i think it 's all too difficult for old people . and how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? user interface : so if you have a universal tv controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . so we have a a period of , i dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and marketing : it 's only for television now . user interface : uh i just thought of another one . most things in modern tvs are also on the menu . project manager : maybe it 's still still a good idea , i 'm not sure . you 'll also have to use a mute button to to user interface : okay , uh now my personal preferences . uh using the standards , basic um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . so when you are in the shop and you see our tv controller hanging , that it stands out . not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . um i dunno . different colours um project manager : just to make it user interface : yeah . well why not ?

'specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , i dunno . uh so so yeah , that 's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh the last point is quite an interesting marketing : yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . and uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but i do n't think it 's uh okay , yeah . yeah , we can uh combine that . uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . uh i think we must t uh take a look at this . it 's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . but it 's uh a tough one . because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty i think . uh next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours tv or something . i do n't we we have n't uh we must n't look too much at uh the last point . okay , last page . project manager : marketing : uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . we did n't uh think about that already . and uh an lcd on the remote control . we already thought about that . um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . and but they 're more critical . and older people uh want to spend uh more money . but uh they uh they do n't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they 're in their old uh thinking way . and they want to keep the old uh things the old things . project manager : people . so yeah , so we just can skip the lcd r on the remote control , marketing : i i think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , project manager : so it has to look uh uh uh unique , it 's on the on the uh net net uh thing , user interface : there it is . okay . technical functions design . okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . is n't that is n't true anymore . but um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . not too full , like uh jens already said , only ten percent is being used . project manager : so what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or user interface : yeah , i have it on the next page . but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . uh an icon on it or text on it , so it 's very clear what that buttons does . so it does n't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control but if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your industrial designer : yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . so you might as well remember the number . or not ? user interface : it 's it was just a thought . so i 'm , i u i would find it handy , i think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . industrial designer : yeah , okay . but um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? user interface : what i was reading on the page . uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . so switch to channel six . so uh button six says says six . and if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . just numbers . that can be in the in the industrial designer : yeah okay . but uh uh for a user to to remember , if i press that button it goes to that channel . no , neither do i . user interface : they do n't like new features . so maybe not . when not anymore for tv . right , on off . i dunno , miss did i miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? i could n't think of any other , 'specially not for tv . industrial designer : but uh um there 's also a button to uh go to the channel you 've been before . like a web browser back button . project manager : and how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? user interface : yeah , the ten plus button . just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . but i think that 's in the tv as well . that 's how the uh the tv tv handles it . but you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes . so you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . so if you have a universal tv controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . so we have a a period of , i dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and uh i just thought of another one . most things in modern tvs are also on the menu . project manager : maybe it 's still still a good idea , i 'm not sure . you 'll also have to use a mute button to to marketing : user interface : okay , uh now my personal preferences . uh using the standards , basic um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . so when you are in the shop and you see our tv controller hanging , that it stands out . not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . project manager : yeah . does it have to be uh it has to be uh with different colours it 's like a imac or something . just to make it oh , you just i dunno what happened . we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we wo n't make it . user interface : yeah , i i 'm finished . i think we discussed everything . uh j is marketing : yeah , that 's active . project manager : okay , we make it red . you have to the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . uh that 's cool . marketing : empty . industrial designer : project manager : green or red or whatever , it is cool . industrial designer : and uh the receptor in the tv senses the pattern . so we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . so that it can be used with all the tvs . we have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o on the otherwise it wo n't work . user interface : so we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh marketing : an automatically search function for each television , or something . user interface : and list of all the tvs you have , etcetera . and you have to put in a number , so it works on your tv . industrial designer : marketing : it uh search uh the pattern for itself . industrial designer : but uh ma basically for uh brands of tv these patterns are different . so like when you press a one on one tv it go go to one . and on the other tv it wo n't work , basically . so uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . and uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . marketing : industrial designer : um that 's connecting to all the components . project manager : okay . so that 's the led , l_e_d_ . marketing : uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . but one you ca n't see and one indicates that you use a button . user interface : yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . industrial designer : n n yeah . you have your finger over the button . so you can see user interface : uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . project manager : so this oh , sorry . wh what 's that ? so uh oh , sorry . we have some new uh project requirements . we have to have a look what they are . they 're still in um uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . so a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . i 'm not sure . i do n't think so , industrial designer : and i i think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . marketing : okay . user interface : industrial designer : that kinda changes the whole situation . user interface : well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . i think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , project manager : that still stays . user interface : to make it more like a mobile phone . more modern . marketing : oh , i 'm watching uh the channel one . okay . no , it 's not user interface : yeah , i tho i think that 's not usable . so , but uh yeah . what other features can we put in ? marketing : only the numbers , only numbers . uh furthermore nothing . but only the numbers , one to twenty or something . user interface : i d yeah . i do n't think it 's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . marketing : okay , no speech recognition . project manager : you can see on the uh so we have to know what we 're going to put on . do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? do if you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? okay , we just take that one . marketing : no , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . project manager : different colours . okay , okay . and so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . we put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . marketing : but you have you had a lot of different buttons . project manager : yeah , maybe you have you have to uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . user interface : yeah okay , but yeah , well w i think the buttons are very easy . with just uh standard buttons we just have so little project manager : o but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . because you ne almost never use it . user interface : no , i do n't need do n't need uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . i use teletext as well . marketing : industrial designer : user interface : </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> marketing : unless uh things have suddenly change again . project manager : is it much changes ? uh i did n't no no . i do hot have only the same information . i believe uh miss uh tentel is with us as well , in the control room . industrial designer : well , that 's where the thinking goes on . i think you should punish him . possibilities , yeah ? user interface : welcome . uh project manager : the third meeting . um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? industrial designer : not at all . project manager : we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . forty minutes in total for this . so um i think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you 've made . um i think it might be smart to look at uh ruud 's um information first , because i understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . marketing : . uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . simple shapes uh m material . but we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group project manager : uh w wait a sec wait a se industrial designer : not something dull . marketing : no , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . industrial designer : has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? project manager : okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it should n't be too hard . it it maybe it rubber or or marketing : yeah , exactly . yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that does n't mean we should use wood , so well , this this is an example of what they would like . but since we 're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , i think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . user interface : yeah , o o i 'm thinking about uh the bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh siemens . the yellow uh rubber telephone . it looks likes a banana . we have the fruit , we have the colours . we have the simple design . marketing : i 've seen it , project manager : okay . okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . industrial designer : so so ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . and what was even more important ? okay . so that 's the most important thing for our customers . user interface : mm-hmm . well , i do n't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . um project manager : okay , well it 's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . s because um industrial designer : so you can get a really good grip on it . so you you do n't have to um attain much pressure to it . it 's it 's a lot easier . but i 'll i 'll go into that deeper in my presentation . project manager : i think um , if if i can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . user interface : you you walk project manager : yeah . and wha user interface : but i th i do n't think uh the scroll-wheels i had some i had some information about it too . project manager : well user interface : yeah , uh that 's a possibility , industrial designer : uh it 's do it 's done before . project manager : volume ? thi i i m i guess uh th and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . so i 'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . so maybe um i guess that that 's something you two uh need to think about . marketing : um uh well , user interface : wheel . industrial designer : and well , it 's it 's been done years ago and i do n't see it anywhere now . so maybe it 's not no . um no , but i think that 's something for uh roo here to think about . user interface : but what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? so if you use titanium industrial designer : the titanium thing uh we have to skip it . project manager : so um industrial designer : and we should uh use wood or something like that . i do n't think c our customers will like it . so i think this is the best of two worlds . it 's very unlogical . project manager : well industrial designer : well the there has to be some pointing at . but project manager : but if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . industrial designer : and uh skip and skip the lcd part . technology . project manager : and i mean lcd is well , ok i know , but it 's m it 's less um s standard than than well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . that 's the problem . because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , i would say do integrate it , industrial designer : uh i think our customers will go insane . project manager : yeah . okay , i i agree . i think i ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or industrial designer : okay . uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f flores ? project manager : well , we we need to describe uh decisions now . on the energy , well , we decided . the case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . i guess that is something for roo and sebastian . uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . and for you , the product evaluation . um i 'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . um and uh the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard . user interface : the project drawing is for the next project manager : yeah , it 's it 's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . industrial designer : okay . so can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we 've made ? project manager : great . um uh you you need to help me . um user interface : but can there be uh wor can they work together ? or do we have to choose between them ? industrial designer : okay . what about uh the finishing of the case ? we have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? project manager : uh if it 's possible with uh different um covers , but i 'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . industrial designer : but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . they 're actually very slow in its techniques . project manager : okay , so we have to deal with wh what 's possible here . yeah . okay . um more f more more decisions we made . um um . uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ? user interface : it is not uh something uh it 's no information i read about it or so , but it 's just from project manager : yeah , but this is on the pla user interface : you have to draw the project manager : what about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? yeah . well actually , we should have it the other way around , i guess . a plastic cover with rubber finishing . i mean , this is this is the finishing . this is um what 's on the edge . what you feel . industrial designer : i do . project manager : okay . well , we do not have very much time uh left . um i guess you two have to figure that out . i 'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so i 'm going to leave it the decision with you . um sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? user interface : regular . industrial designer : and we 've decided not to use lcd . user interface : . for the finishing touch . but um sebastian has everything . </s>
<s> what 's the decision of the whole meeting ? </s> industrial designer : well , that 's where the thinking goes on . user interface : you wish . industrial designer : possibilities , yeah ? user interface : welcome . uh project manager : the third meeting . um i think it might be smart to look at uh ruud 's um information first , because i understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . marketing : . yeah . yeah . my method ? user interface : marketing : uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . simple shapes uh m material . but we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group project manager : uh w wait a sec wait a se marketing : well , uh one example given was this , so um i assume they just want something colourful . not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . user interface : you said in the p marketing : no , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . user interface : okay . well then i suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . industrial designer : has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?

<s> summarize the discussion about remote control style . </s> project manager : uh w wait a sec wait a se industrial designer : uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?

this is my volume button . and i can either on this side or this side um industrial designer : okay . yes . well , okay . well , that that that 's one possibility , okay . project manager : and click it to muten the device . so maybe um i guess that that 's something you two uh need to think about . user interface : wheel . project manager : well , all the sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . nokia has a well , okay , it 's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . industrial designer : hmm . yes , but it uses two separate buttons . project manager : yeah . i know , it 's not really a scroll-wheel . no . yeah . user interface : yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . marketing : yeah , industrial designer : okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , i think uh they they can be they can be handy . user interface : okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker project manager : but but do we want the curved uh uh design , industrial designer : i think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it 's too dull . i do n't think c our customers will like it . and um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you can not um you can only use the rubber buttons and you can not use the scroll-wheels . project manager : yeah . okay . okay . industrial designer : yes . it 's it 's uh i uh i can imagine it 's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . user interface : but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all . project manager : well , it depends on your walls actually . if you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you 're probably right . but if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . industrial designer : i think uh it gives us the advantage of user interface : and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . yeah . project manager : and i mean lcd is okay , okay . industrial designer : okay . uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the okay , okay . user interface : uh but uh ca n't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ?

industrial designer : so yes , they can . but they really need the regular chip , you can not use the sa simple user interface : okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker project manager : but but do we want the curved uh uh design , industrial designer : i think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it 's too dull . and um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you can not um you can only use the rubber buttons and you can not use the scroll-wheels . yes . it 's it 's uh i uh i can imagine it 's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . user interface : but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all . project manager : well , it depends on your walls actually . if you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you 're probably right . industrial designer : so it has an it 's easier . um i suggest we use the the sensor sample . uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . um with a with a regular chip . i think uh it gives us the advantage of user interface : and and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . yeah . industrial designer : i do n't think it it 's any uh value added thing . project manager : because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , i would say do integrate it , because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . user interface : but we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . project manager : okay , okay . industrial designer : it 's it 's too much . project manager : the case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . industrial designer : okay , okay . user interface : uh but uh ca n't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ?

<s> what did the group discuss about user interface controls of the remote control ? </s> project manager : so i could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . um the second thing , um i was th uh s thinking to myself , i have this little remote control , and i 'm talking to it , but i still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . that 's quite strange . marketing : 'kay . hmm ? industrial designer : just press the okay button , it works . project manager : um yeah . uh w wait a sec wait a se marketing : 'kay . well , uh one example given was this , so um i assume they just want something colourful . not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . user interface : you said in the p industrial designer : but can you can you go back to that slide ? the uh project manager : well , that 's interesting . yeah , yeah . okay . okay . um uh user interface : uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . well , a few interface i uh i found on the internet are are these . these are both with uh with voice recognition , but they 're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape . project manager : and what i 'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um i mean this is how you hold a remote control . user interface : so it 's easy in your hand uh indeed . industrial designer : yes . there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . so you you do n't have to um attain much pressure to it . it 's it 's a lot easier . project manager : okay , good . user interface : oh and um to add on um ruud 's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . so if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . industrial designer : okay , but i 'll i 'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . um i had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . uh these are the things we 've looked at . and of course i used the web to uh find my information . about the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . we have the uncurved or flat case . uh that 's the most common uh remote con control form uh we 're used to is just a it ju it 's just a box . i 'm sorry i i do n't have any pictures of uh of this thing . we have uh a curved one . it 's uh curved in two dimensions . you have to imagine it 's a bit like a wave form . so it 's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . project manager : okay . industrial designer : uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . i c i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . the the big remote control , something like that . user interface : yeah . right . like the watch . industrial designer : mm-hmm . indeed . user interface : but if you 're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and industrial designer : mm-hmm . yes . project manager : yeah . and wha industrial designer : well , m it might not work . so that 's something you have to keep in mind . project manager : okay , because i guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . industrial designer : uh yes , it does . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . so we do n't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four user interface : mm-hmm . oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . but i th i do n't think uh the scroll-wheels i had some i had some information about it too . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : i d i ca n't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . project manager : um with uh maybe a channel selector . what about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? user interface : yeah , uh that 's a possibility , but flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for project manager : this is my volume button . and i can either on this side or this side um and click it to muten the device . and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . so i 'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . industrial designer : mm-hmm . yes . project manager : nokia has a well , okay , it 's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . industrial designer : hmm . yes , but it uses two separate buttons . user interface : yeah , i believe uh if you have uh what we 've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . industrial designer : yes . yes . yeah , yeah . okay . project manager : okay . sebastian . um industrial designer : okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . there 's no way you can integrate lcd displays . there 's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it 's all curved . there 's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . so that 's a limitation . about um the components , uh just the hardware . we basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . but i think that 's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . user interface : yeah yeah , you can um i have some information about it . uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . of mute , let 's say mute . um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that 's really the mute function industrial designer : mm-hmm . yeah . user interface : and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that 's the sample sensor . so so if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it 's um well , i believe it 's uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : so you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . industrial designer : um no , but i think that 's something for uh roo here to think about . user interface : yeah . well , i do n't have um i have n't looked for uh for information about it , but i do n't think information uh y i do n't think you need it on a display . industrial designer : i i do n't think either . project manager : on screen display . yeah . industrial designer : okay . okay , well project manager : okay . good . industrial designer : so i do n't think we should use the dynamo thing . uh well . user interface : okay . oh , industrial designer : and um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you can not um you can only use the rubber buttons and you can not use the scroll-wheels . project manager : yeah . okay . okay . industrial designer : yes . it 's it 's uh i uh i can imagine it 's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . user interface : but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all . industrial designer : well the there has to be some pointing at . but so it has an it 's easier . um i suggest we use the the sensor sample . uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . um with a with a regular chip . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : okay , okay . industrial designer : okay , okay . project manager : keep it in mind . and um the buttons , well we talked about it now . the next phase , um sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . the user interface design . industrial designer : yes . mm-hmm . project manager : uh if it 's possible with uh different um covers , but i 'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . user interface : i believe the but you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button . and um well well industrial designer : but uh i 'm afraid it 's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . because uh i agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . but okay , so scroll-wheel . but there will be some additional buttons , i guess . user interface : yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . in the rubber . project manager : i think rubber is nice . because it uh i i mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i user interface : yeah , b but then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . marketing : uh did n't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . project manager : yeah . you could place a um uh this this would be the button . marketing : there the icons . industrial designer : that 's okay . marketing : so you do n't touch the icons that much . project manager : yeah , but this is on the pla industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : i know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ? user interface : or the the back . or the back . project manager : yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . the side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ? okay . well , we do not have very much time uh left . um i guess you two have to figure that out . i 'm going to leave the decision to you , okay , well . </s>

user interface : yeah , uh that 's a possibility , but but flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for industrial designer : okay . yes . well , okay . well , that that that 's one possibility , okay . project manager : and click it to muten the device . and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . so i 'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . marketing : um uh well , industrial designer : hmm . but it 's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . we use this . and well , it 's it 's been done years ago and i do n't see it anywhere now . project manager : well , all the sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . industrial designer : so maybe it 's not no . project manager : nokia has a well , okay , it 's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . industrial designer : hmm . yes , but it uses two separate buttons . project manager : yeah . i know , it 's not really a scroll-wheel . no . yeah . user interface : so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . industrial designer : mm-hmm . okay . okay . so so user interface : and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . that 's the sample sensor . so so if you say mute , it says mute again , so you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . industrial designer : um no , but i think that 's something for uh roo here to think about . user interface : yeah . well , i do n't have um i have n't looked for uh for information about it , but i do n't think information uh y i do n't think you need it on a display . especially when when we have to look at a cost , i do n't think uh industrial designer : i i do n't think either . no . i do n't think you need it . okay . okay , well so i do n't think we should use the dynamo thing . otherwise it will not too advanced , project manager : too user interface : okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker project manager : or industrial designer : yes . it 's it 's uh i uh i can imagine it 's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . user interface : but most infrared uh remote controls do n't have to be pointed at all . project manager : well industrial designer : well the there has to be some pointing at . but project manager : it depends also on your on your well , it depends on your walls actually . if you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you 're probably right . industrial designer : all lights get absorbed , yeah . so it has an it 's easier . um i suggest we use the the sensor sample . uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . um with a with a regular chip . project manager : because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , i would say do integrate it , okay , okay . industrial designer : it 's it 's too much . marketing : nah , um n no , i do n't think so . m industrial designer : yes . mm-hmm . project manager : uh if it 's possible with uh different um covers , but i 'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . user interface : i believe the but you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button . and um well well well , there is . just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , industrial designer : so so i 'm afraid it 's not possible . okay , so scroll-wheel . but there will be some additional buttons , i guess . user interface : yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . in the rubber . yeah , b but then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . no , but but uh it marketing : 'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . project manager : the scroll-wheel , i mean . and you could place the indica th th the signals the user interface : yeah , that 's possible , project manager : yeah , but this is on the pla industrial designer : yes , the signs . user interface : yeah , it 's on the cover . so if you uh you just move the problem . project manager : i mean industrial designer : well , i 'm i 'm not so sure , project manager : i know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ? industrial designer : i think and and we 've decided not to use lcd . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> project manager : they are . industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . project manager : okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um we just do the best we can . we have new project requirements , um we 're not going to be using teletext , um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . um our control is only going to be for tv , it 's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , yeah , i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but i do n't know , what do you think ? it just said , for tv only . but i mean , general tv controls do do video as well . industrial designer : t yeah yeah . i d well i dunno 'cause uh the w if you 've g project manager : mm . i think we assume that it 's still got play and stop functions and programming . marketing : in fact i 've just called up that table there , and a substantial number of do n't knows in the older age group , i think that 's just general fear of new technology . project manager : um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , i mean what you were talking about with the marketing . um , people paying more for it to look good . um , we need to focus on that as well . marketing : and also across the world if we 're aiming at the international market . what is um attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , i dunno , user interface : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? industrial designer : i mean inside they 'd be essentially exactly the same . no , well no 'cause you would n't have to you do n't actually have to press them you just marketing : mm . mm-hmm . user interface : so , a bigger b okay so y you 're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you 're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . project manager : i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh marketing : th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . project manager : it 's gon na be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . marketing : this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it 's something we should think about . industrial designer : and it becomes marketing : yes . mm-hmm . do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ? um . user interface : we could focus on the biggest market . industrial designer : ge uh marketing : and when we 've been throwing up our ideas we 're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : but i do n't think we 're focusing on that , i think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . marketing : mm . mm . i 'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it 's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . project manager : because you 've got your general record anyway so if you there 's a programme on you want to put record on , that 's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you 're not sure if you 're going to , you put the number in marketing : right , i 've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . project manager : after um if you look in the newspaper , tv guide or any tv guide there 's a five , six digit number afterwards industrial designer : it 's been been around for a long time it 's just it 's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . project manager : no it 's not um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that marketing : superb . mm . industrial designer : but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they 've they 've got an obligation to to help you out marketing : mm . mm-hmm . project manager : the functionality of it in the sense that you 're sitting there , you 're pressing this button and your tv 's not doing it . taking your tv and your control and saying look this is what i 'm doing , it 's not working , what should i do ? industrial designer : i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that . project manager : instruction manuals . but i mean they 're there 's customer service , industrial designer : yeah . department , yeah . marketing : because we 're focusing on that , project manager : mm . but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible user interface : simple . project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . well they la they they last quite a long time , industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah on that as well so . user interface : mm-hmm . marketing : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : um they do . um user interface : y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your project manager : can you look into the company logo ? um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . user interface : current . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that 's there . well we need to think about how it 's gon na look different . user interface : but we can like think of five , six designs . project manager : okay . right , i think we have to round it up , um marketing : can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i have n't missed anything . our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about videoplus . right . right . right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the lcd , a reminder about using videoplus ? so that they have a look at the guide and or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? project manager : um it could be it c it yes , you know , drawing attention to that . and it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it 's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . marketing : was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? user interface : yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . that 's not at the moment a requirement , it 's something we 're looking at , project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are n't gon na be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i do n't know if we deal with that , um . i think and different from what 's out there . yep , i think that 's us . user interface : true . marketing : what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? or shall i just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? </s>
<s> what did the group discuss about battery issues and flip top design ? </s> project manager : um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , tv , video equipment . marketing : is that appropriate ? you 're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? industrial designer : um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they 're quite they 're quite chunky and that 's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i 'm just wondering about power consumption um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do . it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment . and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , project manager : um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . um our control is only going to be for tv , it 's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , marketing : mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? industrial designer : and if you got if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the tv anyway so on to on to like the tv hard drive or so . project manager : mm . i think we assume that it 's still got play and stop functions and programming . marketing : um we did n't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , user interface : ten perc marketing : i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on industrial designer : and they 're not that great anyway . yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it 'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i thought that could be quite a project manager : we do have a budget limitation that we ca n't control ourselves , so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing maybe on the tv you could put like a pack on the tv or something so you ca n't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the tv and it beeps marketing : yes . that 's a super idea . yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty project manager : yeah ? um so you it 's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should n't wear out as much either , not sure about the industrial designer : no , well no 'cause you would n't have to you do n't actually have to press them you just marketing : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm . but also er ergonomics as we 're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there 's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you 've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would n't buy it because the controller was physically to big project manager : were too big . industrial designer : so they could n't get round the controller which is uh so if you i do n't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . user interface : and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . project manager : and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh industrial designer : i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel project manager : which is extremely expensive , user interface : if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? marketing : mm . mm . i 'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate industrial designer : video plus . project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that because you 've got your general record anyway so if you there 's a programme on you want to put record on , that 's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you 're not sure if you 're going to , you put the number in and it 's just a number , it 's not a date , it 's not a time , it 's not a channel , it 's not when it finishes , it 's not anything like that , industrial designer : you just need one 'cause you 've already got all the numbers there anyway , project manager : you 've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . marketing : right , i 've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . project manager : and that 's the number you put in and it 's recorded that it 's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth industrial designer : it 's been been around for a long time it 's just it 's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . though if y if you 've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it 'll record that programme when it 's on and you press it on it twice and it 'll record the whole series . but just to have that function would be would be really good . marketing : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : and also i mean it 's it 's fair enough to have some sort of help service but i i 'm not sure how much the cost would be of having marketing : if it was something as simple as you could n't change the channel , industrial designer : yeah . department , yeah . project manager : and that way there 's no call out charge , there 's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . industrial designer : yeah , they should be f yeah . marketing : because we 're focusing on that , project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong um , what other functions ? we need i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you 've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer : um they 're they 're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but project manager : well they la they they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you 're not using it or t at night or something , but it does n't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . um , something like that should reduce the size of it . yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . industrial designer : yeah on that as well so . user interface : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? industrial designer : some sort of docking station or project manager : rechargeable with a docking station . so the rechargeable which would be your field . industrial designer : and also that would mean they would n't have to go out buying batteries all the time . project manager : which it is cheaper in the long run as well . user interface : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . and you do n't have to you do n't bend your thumb too much , so it 's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . marketing : slightly curved , curved . project manager : 'cause it 's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . user interface : the way you h hold of it 's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . we could look in at that but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . a sea shell ? marketing : then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . i think it 's a really nice idea user interface : yeah we could look in at that . project manager : so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and marketing : yeah . mm-hmm . less chance of it being lost too , it 's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that 's gon na go down the sofa user interface : that could be the most common design . project manager : okay . right , i think we have to round it up , um that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date um it could be it c it yes , marketing : mm , and the rechargeable batteries . mm-hmm . that 's not at the moment a requirement , it 's something we 're looking at , project manager : yes . yes . learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are n't gon na be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i do n't know if we deal with that , um . i think </s>

'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the tv to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the tv or other appliance that it 's sending the signal to . um , so i decided i 'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wan na make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it was n't really my area because i 'm dealing with the inside really . so um , yeah i ran out of time so i could n't do this one as fun as the last one . marketing : mm-hmm . could i can i interject to ask a question there , industrial designer : yeah sure . user interface : okay . project manager : they are . industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . marketing : okay . industrial designer : um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do . it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment . and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , marketing : mm . mm . industrial designer : i th that was just sort of a general point there . and that 's uh yeah . marketing : that 's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . industrial designer : alright okay , and yeah , that 's that 's what i came up with there , project manager : okay , thank you very much . um , would you like to continue on from that ? user interface : 'kay . it can be okay , that 's okay with me . further . oops . why 's it not working ? f_ eight , right ? project manager : f_ function . industrial designer : function f_ eight yeah . user interface : okay . mm why 's it in the right ? marketing : no . the plug has n't come out at the bottom , has it ? no . user interface : yeah , it 's connecting . industrial designer : no , no yeah it 's just . user interface : okay . project manager : oh , there . user interface : yeah . actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william 's just mention , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip-top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it 's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? yeah , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : with that i think we 'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . um , that 's so this is if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . industrial designer : uh you should be able to and project manager : yeah , you might . industrial designer : yeah , there you go . marketing : get it right over , okay , thank you . project manager : ah . look at that . marketing : okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking . um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , user interface : yeah . marketing : so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . so again there 's power implications there . um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control . um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions . um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they 're not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , user interface : 'kay . marketing : but i think i 'll just keep it simple , industrial designer : user interface : that 's fine . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : is that okay ? project manager : but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . marketing : um we did n't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , industrial designer : and they 're not that great anyway . marketing : and a substantial number of do n't knows in the older age group , i think that 's just general fear of new technology . yes . that 's a super idea . project manager : um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , i mean what you were talking about with the marketing . um , people paying more for it to look good . um , we need to focus on that as well . marketing : yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty user interface : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? marketing : yes it will appeal to sections of the market def project manager : and it 's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um were too big . industrial designer : so they could n't get round the controller which is uh so if you i do n't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . project manager : i think we have to design one product in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . marketing : yes . mm-hmm . do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . do we really have to go for everyone right away ? um . user interface : we could focus on the biggest market . if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? project manager : we are we 're talking about um the type of company that we 're working for as well . that they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you would n't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , marketing : mm . mm . i 'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate excellent , mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that yeah . marketing : can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i do n't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , sure , okay . i think that 's that sounds a really attractive idea , </s>

you 're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? industrial designer : um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they 're quite they 're quite chunky and that 's because of the size of the batteries , marketing : right , the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? industrial designer : and how much you need to send the data across . um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . um , now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it 's not gon na work , uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gon na choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you 're putting in from from the controller now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who 's watching the tv unless they 're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we 're applying to the most audience that should be fine . and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wan na do . it 's not a proper circuit , i 'm not sure if it 'd work or not , i 'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you 'd wire it up but anyway , we 've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u_i_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i_r_ data which could be decoded by the tv receiver , which obviously means that we 're gon na have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the tvs are already using and since that that 's another use and reason to use that infrared because that 's what all tvs use at the moment . and then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i 've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about , uh because they 're small they 're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , marketing : mm . mm . industrial designer : i th that was just sort of a general point there . and that 's uh yeah . marketing : that 's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . industrial designer : so if you wan na user interface : 'kay . it can be okay , that 's okay with me . further . oops . why 's it not working ?

project manager : but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . industrial designer : ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it 'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they 're not that great anyway . yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it 'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is project manager : um because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you do n't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the tv you could put like a pack on the tv or something so you ca n't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the tv and it beeps marketing : yes . that 's a super idea . project manager : but that 's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . marketing : yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty project manager : yeah ? um so you it 's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should n't wear out as much either , not sure about the marketing : mm . mm-hmm . yes it will appeal to sections of the market def industrial designer : mm . but also er ergonomics as we 're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there 's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you 've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would n't buy it because the controller was physically to big so they could n't get round the controller which is uh so if you i do n't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . project manager : and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . which is extremely expensive , user interface : if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? marketing : mm . mm . i 'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that marketing : right , i 've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . industrial designer : it 's been been around for a long time it 's just it 's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . marketing : excellent , mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that yeah . marketing : can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i do n't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? mm . mm-hmm . puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . project manager : you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong marketing : sure , okay . project manager : um , what other functions ? we need i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you 've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer : um they 're they 're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but project manager : well they la they they last quite a long time , but it does n't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . user interface : so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? industrial designer : some sort of docking station or project manager : which it is cheaper in the long run as well . because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . we could look in at that but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , marketing : i think that 's that sounds a really attractive idea , then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . i think it 's a really nice idea user interface : that could be the most common design . marketing : uh-huh . right . right , so it 's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? mm , and the rechargeable batteries . mm-hmm . that 's not at the moment a requirement , it 's something we 're looking at , </s>

f_ eight , right ? okay . mm why 's it in the right ? yeah , it 's connecting . industrial designer : no , no yeah it 's just . user interface : okay . project manager : oh , there . user interface : yeah . actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william 's just mention , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we 'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , i have n't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with tv to make make it as simple as possible . and to summarise i i would say it 's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . so what the concept is to have a flip-top model . the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . so it 's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it 's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? yeah , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : with that i think we 'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . um , that 's so this is if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . industrial designer : uh you should be able to and project manager : ah . look at that . marketing : okay , um , i 'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . um , so that 's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company 's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . our findings , lots of findings , i 've just summarised some of them here . the overall thing which i 've i 've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that 's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that 's a bit nicer looking . um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , user interface : yeah . marketing : so you 've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . so again there 's power implications there . um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we do n't have so many functions actually on the remote control . um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it 's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just ca n't be bothered to learn about the other functions . um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid i think in uh when they 've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . something we did n't put to them , but which i 'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they 're not so bothered with this . i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you , user interface : 'kay . industrial designer : user interface : that 's fine . project manager : okay . yeah . industrial designer : okay . marketing : is that okay ? industrial designer : and they 're not that great anyway . project manager : maybe on the tv you could put like a pack on the tv or something so you ca n't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the tv and it beeps marketing : yes . that 's a super idea . yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it 's gon na be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who 's sixty user interface : so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? project manager : yeah ? um so you it 's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which should n't wear out as much either , not sure about the marketing : mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : mm . but also er ergonomics as we 're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there 's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you 've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan would n't buy it because the controller was physically to big project manager : were too big . industrial designer : because um they 're c uh just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they could n't get round the controller which is uh so if you i do n't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . hmm . huh . project manager : in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . which is extremely expensive , user interface : if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? industrial designer : video plus . project manager : yes . we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that marketing : right , i 've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . industrial designer : it 's been been around for a long time it 's just it 's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . marketing : excellent , mm-hmm . industrial designer : so that yeah . marketing : can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , i do n't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that 's kind of what led us on to comparing tv remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you 've got any problems with it and they 'll fix it , mm . mm-hmm . sure , okay . project manager : um , what other functions ? we need i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you 've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer : um they 're they 're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but project manager : well they la they they last quite a long time , yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . industrial designer : some sort of docking station or user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . we could look in at that but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , marketing : i think that 's that sounds a really attractive idea , user interface : that could be the most common design . marketing : so it 's no teletext , it 's only for tv and by implication video , uh-huh . right . right , so it 's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? mm , and the rechargeable batteries . mm-hmm . that 's not at the moment a requirement , it 's something we 're looking at , </s>

th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? mm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , they should be f yeah . marketing : sure , okay . project manager : um , what other functions ? we need i 'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you 've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that 's what i was thinking about . mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? industrial designer : um they 're they 're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but project manager : well they la they they last quite a long time , but it does n't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . yeah it could be on that yeah , okay . industrial designer : some sort of docking station or project manager : which it is cheaper in the long run as well . because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , user interface : what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . marketing : slightly curved , curved . user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , user interface : we could look in at that but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , marketing : i think that 's that sounds a really attractive idea , then it 's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you 're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that 's gon na take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . i think it 's a really nice idea user interface : that could be the most common design . project manager : that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date marketing : uh-huh . right . right , so it 's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? mm-hmm . that 's not at the moment a requirement , it 's something we 're looking at , project manager : learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . but there are n't gon na be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual , i do n't know if we deal with that , um . i think yes , right . okay . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> dr rachel bowen : and i think that that varies by size of employer as well . that , certainly , where there are larger employers , who 've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum , they may have more capacity to follow changes , get up to date with how welsh education is evolving . but we know that most employers in wales are small or microbusinesses . and while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand , the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business . and that means it 's quite a challenge to understand what is the welsh bac , what does it offer . and , certainly , when that 's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes , it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those , i imagine . nick brazil : could i add to that ? as do many of my colleagues within the colleges , we have a number of employer boards , which we regularly meet with—employers—and i can not think back as to how many employers say to us , 'that is what we require—the welsh bac—to come and work within our industry . ' most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors . not many of them have indicated that the welsh bac is providing the skills that they require . i think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the welsh bac initially , but the welsh bac has turned into quite a rigorous , some would say demanding , qualification , which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy , in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year , and whether that 's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable . and , as i said , from the employer boards that we have , very few of them understand the welsh bac . they certainly do n't mention the welsh bac and , as i said , are very much questioning the qualifications that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries . kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . sian gwenllian am : what are we going to do , then , to improve employers ' understanding of the welsh bac , and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while , if you feel that it is worth while , of course ? dafydd evans : i think we need to review the qualification , and i think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification . and i think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board , i think the employers— . and the only way we 'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what 's being done . because i think that 's what the vision was for the welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment . but , somehow or other we 've lost our way . the aim is an excellent one , but i think we 've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day , and i think having more input from employers would be a great help . ed evans : i would agree . i think we do need more employers involved in this . i think there are opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than we do at the moment . i suppose that the bee in my bonnet is that we are involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector , and that to me is a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way . it happens at the moment . it 's the community benefits clauses that are in construction contracts . they 're there to serve a really good purpose , but it 's become a little bit piecemeal and a little bit tokenistic , whereas the welsh bac offers an opportunity— . it 's something that 's part of the curriculum . it 's clearly not functioning well at the moment . it would benefit from that business input . so , why not link up those contractual clauses , which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more structured way of getting employers into schools ? at the moment it 's a little bit—we 'll pick up the phone , we 'll get a phone call , and it 'll be , 'can you come and do something for us ? ' it 's tokenistic . we need to be far more clever in terms of how we join these things up , and then i think you 'll start to get that business input there , but let 's not be ad hoc about it . kay martin : could i just add something ? we 've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well . career ready is a national programme , which we use in the college and which other colleges across the uk use . that 's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme , from employment , and they all go out for at least six weeks ' internship . so , they do n't go for a day 's work placement or two days—they go for six-week internships . some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations . we 've got btec learners who have gone through that programme and gone into law degrees with freshfields law in london , which is one of the top law firms in the world . so , there are lots of other programmes as well , and perhaps there 's a way of joining it all up together . but , in the college , we 've got several different programmes going on with employers and the welsh bac is one of them , but it 's not the one that engages employers the best , certainly in our college . nick brazil : i think that is a very good question , but i will go back to ed 's point , which i think was a very important point , which is that the initial vision for the welsh bac—i think when we go back a number of years—was a really good , good vision for the welsh bac . it was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills , and certainly employability skills , and i think it 's lost its way since then . it 's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification , and it 's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills . and that 's what happens , unfortunately . but i think what ed said is absolutely right : if you get the engagement of the employers— . but you 've got to listen to what kay said as well : there are programmes already out there . so , why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well ? i will go to the enhanced programmes , enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that i know run in other colleges , which are much , much more focused on skills , much more focused in linking with industry , and they work extremely well . the actual progress of learners into employment is happening . so , i think the question is : have we got programmes already in place , and do we need another one on top ? but the vision initially for the welsh bac , as i said , i will always be positive about . the vision was a good one . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . dafydd evans : that 's been a new dimension lately , i think , in that , when the welsh bac first hit fe , we were leading the way— janet finch-saunders am : okay . a question , then , just to colegaucymru : to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the welsh bac ? nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . dafydd evans : i mentioned before coming in , in terms of the context— . because of the nature of our catchment area , there is a greater percentage of our students staying in welsh universities , and , as kay said , welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac . so , to a certain extent , it is less of a problem . but , naturally , we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in england in the russell group , and we 're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do . ' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . julie morgan am : right . and those skills that are learnt in the welsh bac , can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications ? because i know that cambridge university said to us they thought , in the four a-levels that they asked for , that those skills were there . lynne neagle am : and you 've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner . are you aware , then , of any young people who are coming to you from the swansea area because they 've got that flexibility , which they may not have in one of the local schools ? dafydd evans : we certainly have experience of that , of young people coming in with quite a negative attitude , originally , to the welsh bac and taking it on board . but where we are delivering it well , well contextualised , they 've really enjoyed the experience , and very much valued the experience . so , yes , there are certainly instances of that happening , there 's no doubt . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . a lot of this has been covered , actually , but just on those final points there , i 'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the welsh bac would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on . what do you think about that ? dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . kay martin : on their timetables , yes . and as you say , industry specialists delivering some of those things put them more into context . </s>
<s> what did the group discuss about how much employers understood the meaning of welsh bac ? </s> kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . nick brazil : i think that is a very good question , but i will go back to ed 's point , which i think was a very important point , which is that the initial vision for the welsh bac—i think when we go back a number of years—was a really good , good vision for the welsh bac . it was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills , and certainly employability skills , and i think it 's lost its way since then . it 's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification , and it 's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills . and that 's what happens , unfortunately . but i think what ed said is absolutely right : if you get the engagement of the employers— . but you 've got to listen to what kay said as well : there are programmes already out there . so , why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well ? i will go to the enhanced programmes , enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that i know run in other colleges , which are much , much more focused on skills , much more focused in linking with industry , and they work extremely well . the actual progress of learners into employment is happening . so , i think the question is : have we got programmes already in place , and do we need another one on top ? but the vision initially for the welsh bac , as i said , i will always be positive about . the vision was a good one . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . janet finch-saunders am : thank you . good morning . what are your views on how well the welsh bac , at all levels , helps to prepare learners for employment ? we 've spoken to quite a few learners , and again we 've had variable opinions coming back , so it 's quite how they , from their perspective— . dafydd evans : i think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities . and one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges , and they need to resit their gcses—in maths , english and welsh . it 's a valid priority for the welsh government for everyone to get a c grade in the core subjects . but that eats into the time that we have to teach young people . and so there 's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications . so , the priorities , i think , across the sector— . we 've given priority to gcse resits rather than doing the welsh bac at present . so , at levels 1 and 2 , there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they 're resitting their gcses , and there is much more use of the welsh bac at level 3 , and a-level , and vocational level 3 . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . well , we do n't think they do , really , especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to russell group universities . they do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade . i talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a russell group university because she had the welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . but i think it is mixed , and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they 're going into in universities . in some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—university of south wales , cardiff metropolitan university—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to cardiff met , and business studies , when our learners go to usw . it is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield—and we 're always trying to push our learners beyond . where they can afford to go away to university , we encourage that . but some of the universities are not valuing the welsh baccalaureate . cardiff university—yes . my daughter 's example—that was cardiff university . so , they do , especially now it 's graded at level 3. then they do accept it . a great number of our learners get into cardiff using the welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four a-levels ? absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do .

' if somebody comes from a welsh-medium school , then usually i will speak to the head and make sure that we have a programme in place , that either they 're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of welsh , or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their welsh language skills . we do n't say , 'come to us and you do n't have to do the welsh bac , ' because if they do a-levels , we say it 's compulsory , unless you 're in the seren group . no , it is n't used . in the majority of colleges across wales , it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool , because most of us , as you see , we value the welsh bac . we 'd like some changes to the welsh bac , but we value the welsh bac in many cases . so , we would n't deliberately— . i mean , if a course in my college does n't want to do the welsh bac , they have to come and give me evidence about why they do n't think it 's fit and what they 're going to do in place of it . so , we do n't deliberately tell people , 'come on in and you wo n't have to do it . ' dafydd evans : yes , but across the whole of level 3 , a-level and vocational , the welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum , and it is n't an option for the student to opt out . nick brazil : i 've got to be honest , at present , with our college , we do not ask . it 's compulsory for a-level students to do the welsh bac . it 's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and i think it comes back to that fact that we 're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions . i think it 's something we all need to consider across the nation , that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future . i will go back to the point i made earlier—everything 's comparable as long as it 's the right thing for the learner 's future , and i genuinely believe , and i 'm sure a lot of colleagues believe , that that choice element is important to a learner , okay . if it is the right choice and if the welsh bac is the right choice , that is correct , and we move that along . obviously , we debated about where there are elements that need to change . but you 've got to be doing the right things for the learner , and we are certainly not selling it , 'come to us ; you do n't do the welsh bac . ' it is part of what we offer . it is part of what the college 's curriculum offers—there is no doubt about that—and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future . sian gwenllian am : that 's a question . kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . </s>

<s> what did they decide on how to improve employers ' understanding of the welsh bac ? </s> kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . ed evans : —just so that a lot of our members will understand when i 'm speaking . i think it 's fair to say employers do n't understand it , that 's for sure , but i think if they did , they would really appreciate this . for my sector in particular—the civil engineering sector—and particularly the contracting sector , which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background , the welsh bac gives them that ability , i guess , not to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to— . and i think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this , and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it , they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry . and some children , some pupils , some young people , they respond far , far better to that . and i think that 's the issue for me—that we 've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them . all of my understanding of this is literally as a parent , and that would be true of a lot of employers as well . so , perhaps there are differences across the sector , but i think , certainly for my sector , we would really value the growth of the welsh baccalaureate . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . dr rachel bowen : and this , ultimately , has to be about what 's in the best interests of learners , and a one-size-fits-all approach is n't going to work . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . well , we do n't think they do , really , especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to russell group universities . they do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade . i talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a russell group university because she had the welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . but i think it is mixed , and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they 're going into in universities . in some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—university of south wales , cardiff metropolitan university—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to cardiff met , and business studies , when our learners go to usw . it is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield—and we 're always trying to push our learners beyond . where they can afford to go away to university , we encourage that . but some of the universities are not valuing the welsh baccalaureate . cardiff university—yes . my daughter 's example—that was cardiff university . so , they do , especially now it 's graded at level 3. then they do accept it . a great number of our learners get into cardiff using the welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four a-levels ? absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . dafydd evans : i mentioned before coming in , in terms of the context— . because of the nature of our catchment area , there is a greater percentage of our students staying in welsh universities , and , as kay said , welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac . so , to a certain extent , it is less of a problem . but , naturally , we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in england in the russell group , and we 're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities . nick brazil : i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do . ' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . dr rachel bowen : i think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent , inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance . that whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we 've discussed , that 's a real positive . the chances are that we 've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification . the approach is a positive one . i think it 's perfectly possible for learners to reach fe college having attained the welsh bac under the process that you 've described , and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see . kay martin : no , it is n't used . in the majority of colleges across wales , it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool , because most of us , as you see , we value the welsh bac . we 'd like some changes to the welsh bac , but we value the welsh bac in many cases . so , we would n't deliberately— . i mean , if a course in my college does n't want to do the welsh bac , they have to come and give me evidence about why they do n't think it 's fit and what they 're going to do in place of it . so , we do n't deliberately tell people , 'come on in and you wo n't have to do it . ' lynne neagle am : and you 've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner . are you aware , then , of any young people who are coming to you from the swansea area because they 've got that flexibility , which they may not have in one of the local schools ? nick brazil : as i said , in terms of our offer , we offer a range in the curriculum . we 're not going out there saying , 'come to us for this particular reason . ' sian gwenllian am : that 's a question . kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . ed evans : i was just going to add there , really , if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular , if you 've got that far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this— . apologies , i 'd almost forgotten that we were in the colegau thing , i was thinking 'schools ' actually [ laughter . ] but in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way , not an ad-hoc way , which is just a friend turning up to talk about something , a structured way— . we have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum ' in the sector that we hope to roll out . now , if that was rolled out across the board—i 'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular , but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled , global areas , because it 's not their bag . so , bring in some experts , bring in some business , raise the profile , and i think then , possibly , you 'll start to get parents thinking , 'actually , there is something more to this than just the academic bit .

<s> summarize the views about how well the welsh bac helped to prepare learners for employment . </s> suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . dafydd evans : i think that one of the problems is that there are a number of priorities . and one of the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges , and they need to resit their gcses—in maths , english and welsh . it 's a valid priority for the welsh government for everyone to get a c grade in the core subjects . but that eats into the time that we have to teach young people . and so there 's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications . so , the priorities , i think , across the sector— . we 've given priority to gcse resits rather than doing the welsh bac at present . so , at levels 1 and 2 , there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they 're resitting their gcses , and there is much more use of the welsh bac at level 3 , and a-level , and vocational level 3 . kay martin : if i could just say as well , our job in the college is to develop skills and employable people , and we use every tool in our box to do that . and , as i said earlier , there are lots of things that we do . the welsh bac , where it works really well , does help prepare them , i think , for employment , but it 's not for everyone , because some people have to do the other things . some people doing the equivalent of three a-levels , even in a vocational programme , it 's too big for them . as you say , they 're coming from schools , some of them with very few gcses , or they have n't got literacy and numeracy skills , they 're being tested and many of them are below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy . so , i think it needs to be reviewed , to look at how we could make skilled and employable people . it helps prepare some people—the a-level students for university—but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable ? no , it does n't . dr rachel bowen : and this , ultimately , has to be about what 's in the best interests of learners , and a one-size-fits-all approach is n't going to work . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ?

' if somebody comes from a welsh-medium school , then usually i will speak to the head and make sure that we have a programme in place , that either they 're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of welsh , or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their welsh language skills . we do n't say , 'come to us and you do n't have to do the welsh bac , ' because if they do a-levels , we say it 's compulsory , unless you 're in the seren group . dafydd evans : yes , but across the whole of level 3 , a-level and vocational , the welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum , and it is n't an option for the student to opt out . nick brazil : i 've got to be honest , at present , with our college , we do not ask . it 's compulsory for a-level students to do the welsh bac . it 's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and i think it comes back to that fact that we 're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions . i think it 's something we all need to consider across the nation , that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future . i will go back to the point i made earlier—everything 's comparable as long as it 's the right thing for the learner 's future , and i genuinely believe , and i 'm sure a lot of colleagues believe , that that choice element is important to a learner , okay . if it is the right choice and if the welsh bac is the right choice , that is correct , and we move that along . obviously , we debated about where there are elements that need to change . but you 've got to be doing the right things for the learner , and we are certainly not selling it , 'come to us ; you do n't do the welsh bac .

' it 's a combination . but , honest answer , i would say parents , a lot of the time , but the learners usually—as i said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that 's why they ask the question straight away . yes , i know , i totally understand , but it 's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners . if you do n't offer the full range , which , sometimes—if you , obviously , limit and you make qualifications compulsory , that can limit the choice of opportunities as well . so , i think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options . there are some places in , i would think , some sixth forms now , where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—welsh bac . so , for example , modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in wales , and , i think , i picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is , 'we have to put our focus on the welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language . ' kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . </s>

absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do . ' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . dafydd evans : i think there 's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the welsh bac in terms of—i do n't think it 's perfect by a long way , however , learners are getting some value out of that process . certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the welsh bac within the vocational area , within the a-level subjects that the learners are doing , are finding it very rewarding . so , there are some very positive things coming out there . i think what we 're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it 's about . kay martin : that is not the case , i would say . when a learner comes to us , we— . i 'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner . in some cases , it 's to go back to school , and we absolutely say , 'you need to go back to school . ' if somebody comes from a welsh-medium school , then usually i will speak to the head and make sure that we have a programme in place , that either they 're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of welsh , or that we make sure that they absolutely keep their welsh language skills . we do n't say , 'come to us and you do n't have to do the welsh bac , ' because if they do a-levels , we say it 's compulsory , unless you 're in the seren group . no , it is n't used . in the majority of colleges across wales , it is absolutely not used as a recruitment tool , because most of us , as you see , we value the welsh bac . we 'd like some changes to the welsh bac , but we value the welsh bac in many cases . so , we would n't deliberately— . i mean , if a course in my college does n't want to do the welsh bac , they have to come and give me evidence about why they do n't think it 's fit and what they 're going to do in place of it . so , we do n't deliberately tell people , 'come on in and you wo n't have to do it . ' dafydd evans : yes , but across the whole of level 3 , a-level and vocational , the welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum , and it is n't an option for the student to opt out . nick brazil : i 've got to be honest , at present , with our college , we do not ask . it 's compulsory for a-level students to do the welsh bac . it 's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and i think it comes back to that fact that we 're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions . i think it 's something we all need to consider across the nation , that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future . i will go back to the point i made earlier—everything 's comparable as long as it 's the right thing for the learner 's future , and i genuinely believe , and i 'm sure a lot of colleagues believe , that that choice element is important to a learner , okay . if it is the right choice and if the welsh bac is the right choice , that is correct , and we move that along . obviously , we debated about where there are elements that need to change . but you 've got to be doing the right things for the learner , and we are certainly not selling it , 'come to us ; you do n't do the welsh bac . ' it is part of what we offer . it is part of what the college 's curriculum offers—there is no doubt about that—and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future . lynne neagle am : and you 've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner . are you aware , then , of any young people who are coming to you from the swansea area because they 've got that flexibility , which they may not have in one of the local schools ? nick brazil : as i said , in terms of our offer , we offer a range in the curriculum . we 're not going out there saying , 'come to us for this particular reason . ' it 's a combination . but , honest answer , i would say parents , a lot of the time , but the learners usually—as i said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that 's why they ask the question straight away . yes , i know , i totally understand , but it 's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners . if you do n't offer the full range , which , sometimes—if you , obviously , limit and you make qualifications compulsory , that can limit the choice of opportunities as well . so , i think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options . there are some places in , i would think , some sixth forms now , where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—welsh bac . so , for example , modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in wales , and , i think , i picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is , 'we have to put our focus on the welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language . ' sian gwenllian am : that 's a question . kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . </s>

no , it does n't . dr rachel bowen : and this , ultimately , has to be about what 's in the best interests of learners , and a one-size-fits-all approach is n't going to work . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ?

<s> summarize the views to what extent they believe that universities understood the value of the welsh bac . </s> sian gwenllian am : kay , is that your experience ? kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . dafydd evans : i think we need to review the qualification , and i think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification . and i think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board , i think the employers— . and the only way we 'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what 's being done . because i think that 's what the vision was for the welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment . but , somehow or other we 've lost our way . the aim is an excellent one , but i think we 've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day , and i think having more input from employers would be a great help . dr rachel bowen : and this , ultimately , has to be about what 's in the best interests of learners , and a one-size-fits-all approach is n't going to work . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . janet finch-saunders am : okay . and then colegaucymru say that , increasingly , the welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level . so , are the different levels of the welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals ? nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ?

' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . dr rachel bowen : and obviously practice will differ across schools . dafydd evans : yes , but across the whole of level 3 , a-level and vocational , the welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum , and it is n't an option for the student to opt out . lynne neagle am : do you let your seren students opt out like they do in cardiff and the vale , or do they have to do it as well ? nick brazil : i 've got to be honest , at present , with our college , we do not ask . it 's compulsory for a-level students to do the welsh bac . it 's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and i think it comes back to that fact that we 're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions . i think it 's something we all need to consider across the nation , that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future . i will go back to the point i made earlier—everything 's comparable as long as it 's the right thing for the learner 's future , and i genuinely believe , and i 'm sure a lot of colleagues believe , that that choice element is important to a learner , okay . if it is the right choice and if the welsh bac is the right choice , that is correct , and we move that along . obviously , we debated about where there are elements that need to change . but you 've got to be doing the right things for the learner , and we are certainly not selling it , 'come to us ; you do n't do the welsh bac . ' it is part of what we offer . it is part of what the college 's curriculum offers—there is no doubt about that—and then people make a choice according to what they need to do to actually progress to what they need to do in their future . lynne neagle am : and you 've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner . are you aware , then , of any young people who are coming to you from the swansea area because they 've got that flexibility , which they may not have in one of the local schools ? nick brazil : as i said , in terms of our offer , we offer a range in the curriculum . we 're not going out there saying , 'come to us for this particular reason . ' it 's a combination . but , honest answer , i would say parents , a lot of the time , but the learners usually—as i said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that 's why they ask the question straight away . sian gwenllian am : i 'm being devil 's advocate . nick brazil : yes , i know , i totally understand , but it 's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners . if you do n't offer the full range , which , sometimes—if you , obviously , limit and you make qualifications compulsory , that can limit the choice of opportunities as well . so , i think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options . there are some places in , i would think , some sixth forms now , where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—welsh bac . so , for example , modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in wales , and , i think , i picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is , 'we have to put our focus on the welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language . ' sian gwenllian am : that 's a question . kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . </s>
<s> what did nick brazil ( deputy principal ) think about to what extent that universities understood the value of the welsh bac ? </s> kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . ed evans : —just so that a lot of our members will understand when i 'm speaking . i think it 's fair to say employers do n't understand it , that 's for sure , but i think if they did , they would really appreciate this . for my sector in particular—the civil engineering sector—and particularly the contracting sector , which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background , the welsh bac gives them that ability , i guess , not to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to— . and i think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this , and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it , they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry . and some children , some pupils , some young people , they respond far , far better to that . and i think that 's the issue for me—that we 've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them . all of my understanding of this is literally as a parent , and that would be true of a lot of employers as well . so , perhaps there are differences across the sector , but i think , certainly for my sector , we would really value the growth of the welsh baccalaureate . nick brazil : i think that is a very good question , but i will go back to ed 's point , which i think was a very important point , which is that the initial vision for the welsh bac—i think when we go back a number of years—was a really good , good vision for the welsh bac . it was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills , and certainly employability skills , and i think it 's lost its way since then . it 's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification , and it 's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills . and that 's what happens , unfortunately . but i think what ed said is absolutely right : if you get the engagement of the employers— . but you 've got to listen to what kay said as well : there are programmes already out there . so , why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well ? i will go to the enhanced programmes , enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that i know run in other colleges , which are much , much more focused on skills , much more focused in linking with industry , and they work extremely well . the actual progress of learners into employment is happening . so , i think the question is : have we got programmes already in place , and do we need another one on top ? but the vision initially for the welsh bac , as i said , i will always be positive about . the vision was a good one . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . well , we do n't think they do , really , especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to russell group universities . they do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade . i talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a russell group university because she had the welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . but i think it is mixed , and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they 're going into in universities . in some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—university of south wales , cardiff metropolitan university—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to cardiff met , and business studies , when our learners go to usw . it is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield—and we 're always trying to push our learners beyond . where they can afford to go away to university , we encourage that . but some of the universities are not valuing the welsh baccalaureate . cardiff university—yes . my daughter 's example—that was cardiff university . so , they do , especially now it 's graded at level 3. then they do accept it . a great number of our learners get into cardiff using the welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four a-levels ? absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . dafydd evans : i mentioned before coming in , in terms of the context— . because of the nature of our catchment area , there is a greater percentage of our students staying in welsh universities , and , as kay said , welsh universities are much more willing to recognise the bac . so , to a certain extent , it is less of a problem . but , naturally , we do have students who are looking to go out to universities in england in the russell group , and we 're having the same experience there where there are differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happens on the ground when students have interviews in those universities . nick brazil : i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ?

<s> summarize their opinions on introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the welsh bac . </s> kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . dafydd evans : i think we need to review the qualification , and i think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification . and i think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board , i think the employers— . and the only way we 'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what 's being done . because i think that 's what the vision was for the welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment . but , somehow or other we 've lost our way . the aim is an excellent one , but i think we 've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day , and i think having more input from employers would be a great help . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . well , we do n't think they do , really , especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to russell group universities . they do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade . i talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a russell group university because she had the welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . but i think it is mixed , and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they 're going into in universities . in some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—university of south wales , cardiff metropolitan university—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to cardiff met , and business studies , when our learners go to usw . it is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield—and we 're always trying to push our learners beyond . where they can afford to go away to university , we encourage that . but some of the universities are not valuing the welsh baccalaureate . cardiff university—yes . my daughter 's example—that was cardiff university . so , they do , especially now it 's graded at level 3. then they do accept it . a great number of our learners get into cardiff using the welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four a-levels ? absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do . ' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . julie morgan am : right . and those skills that are learnt in the welsh bac , can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications ? because i know that cambridge university said to us they thought , in the four a-levels that they asked for , that those skills were there . dr rachel bowen : i think it 's perfectly possible for learners to reach fe college having attained the welsh bac under the process that you 've described , and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see . dafydd evans : yes , but across the whole of level 3 , a-level and vocational , the welsh bac is an integral part of the curriculum , and it is n't an option for the student to opt out . nick brazil : i 've got to be honest , at present , with our college , we do not ask . it 's compulsory for a-level students to do the welsh bac . it 's an option of one of our choices—we have a large choice—and i think it comes back to that fact that we 're just making the assumption all learners are getting all the correct advice and guidance from all the institutions . i think it 's something we all need to consider across the nation , that all learners are getting the right advice and guidance for their future . i will go back to the point i made earlier—everything 's comparable as long as it 's the right thing for the learner 's future , and i genuinely believe , and i 'm sure a lot of colleagues believe , that that choice element is important to a learner , okay . if it is the right choice and if the welsh bac is the right choice , that is correct , and we move that along . obviously , we debated about where there are elements that need to change . but you 've got to be doing the right things for the learner , and we are certainly not selling it , 'come to us ; you do n't do the welsh bac .

' yes , i know , i totally understand , but it 's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners . if you do n't offer the full range , which , sometimes—if you , obviously , limit and you make qualifications compulsory , that can limit the choice of opportunities as well . so , i think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options . there are some places in , i would think , some sixth forms now , where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—welsh bac . so , for example , modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in wales , and , i think , i picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is , 'we have to put our focus on the welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language .

i will go to the enhanced programmes , enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that i know run in other colleges , which are much , much more focused on skills , much more focused in linking with industry , and they work extremely well . the actual progress of learners into employment is happening . so , i think the question is : have we got programmes already in place , and do we need another one on top ? but the vision initially for the welsh bac , as i said , i will always be positive about . the vision was a good one . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ?

' kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . ed evans : i was just going to add there , really , if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular , if you 've got that far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this— . apologies , i 'd almost forgotten that we were in the colegau thing , i was thinking 'schools ' actually [ laughter . ] but in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way , not an ad-hoc way , which is just a friend turning up to talk about something , a structured way— . we have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum ' in the sector that we hope to roll out . now , if that was rolled out across the board—i 'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular , but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled , global areas , because it 's not their bag . so , bring in some experts , bring in some business , raise the profile , and i think then , possibly , you 'll start to get parents thinking , 'actually , there is something more to this than just the academic bit .

<s> what did nick brazil ( deputy principal ) think of introducing a specialist teacher training qualification ? </s> kay martin : certainly , it 's very similar , and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification . they 're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between england and wales , and changes to qualifications . but they want them to get their main qualification . so , if you 're an engineer , they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be literate , numerate , and they want them to have digital skills . and that is n't captured necessarily in the welsh baccalaureate . and , so , the understanding is quite limited amongst the employers we work with . ed evans : —just so that a lot of our members will understand when i 'm speaking . i think it 's fair to say employers do n't understand it , that 's for sure , but i think if they did , they would really appreciate this . for my sector in particular—the civil engineering sector—and particularly the contracting sector , which depends very much on pupils who have come through from a less academic background , the welsh bac gives them that ability , i guess , not to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to— . and i think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this , and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it , they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry . and some children , some pupils , some young people , they respond far , far better to that . and i think that 's the issue for me—that we 've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them . all of my understanding of this is literally as a parent , and that would be true of a lot of employers as well . so , perhaps there are differences across the sector , but i think , certainly for my sector , we would really value the growth of the welsh baccalaureate . dafydd evans : i think we need to review the qualification , and i think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification . and i think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board , i think the employers— . and the only way we 'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what 's being done . because i think that 's what the vision was for the welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment . but , somehow or other we 've lost our way . the aim is an excellent one , but i think we 've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day , and i think having more input from employers would be a great help . nick brazil : i think that is a very good question , but i will go back to ed 's point , which i think was a very important point , which is that the initial vision for the welsh bac—i think when we go back a number of years—was a really good , good vision for the welsh bac . it was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills , and certainly employability skills , and i think it 's lost its way since then . it 's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification , and it 's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills . and that 's what happens , unfortunately . but i think what ed said is absolutely right : if you get the engagement of the employers— . but you 've got to listen to what kay said as well : there are programmes already out there . so , why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well ? i will go to the enhanced programmes , enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that i know run in other colleges , which are much , much more focused on skills , much more focused in linking with industry , and they work extremely well . the actual progress of learners into employment is happening . so , i think the question is : have we got programmes already in place , and do we need another one on top ? but the vision initially for the welsh bac , as i said , i will always be positive about . the vision was a good one . suzy davies am : yes , but that was very useful information for us , because bearing in mind what nick brazil said—that the vision of this was created as almost something that could have the status of something like a duke of edinburgh award without necessarily being a compulsory qualification ; what was important was that the learners got the skills . however , if getting the qualification is how you get the money , then you can see why schools—well , and indeed colleges—might be tempted to go for it . so , thank you for that . diolch . kay martin : many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity . so , at level 1 and level 2 , it 's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges , but at level 3 it 's more , especially for a-levels , because it can help them get into university , but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this , were n't we ? we have learners who do four a-levels , but they do n't do the welsh baccalaureate because they 're part of the seren network , and they are going to be applying for oxbridge or high-level russell group universities . so , the welsh bac , although it 's technically universally adopted by universities , it is n't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university . so , to get into some areas , like dentistry , for example , and some of the other seren-type activities , four a-levels is better . but in most colleges that have a-level students it 's almost compulsory to do the welsh bac as well , but normally that would be three a-levels and the welsh bac—normally . well , we do n't think they do , really , especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to russell group universities . they do allow sometimes that you can drop a grade . i talked earlier about my own daughter who was allowed to drop a grade in order to get into a russell group university because she had the welsh bac as well , but it was a very paper-based exercise . but i think it is mixed , and it does depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they 're going into in universities . in some areas , and certainly the local universities around here—university of south wales , cardiff metropolitan university—value it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , when our students go to cardiff met , and business studies , when our learners go to usw . it is valued by them and they accept it , but when people go further afield—and we 're always trying to push our learners beyond . where they can afford to go away to university , we encourage that . but some of the universities are not valuing the welsh baccalaureate . cardiff university—yes . my daughter 's example—that was cardiff university . so , they do , especially now it 's graded at level 3. then they do accept it . a great number of our learners get into cardiff using the welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four a-levels ? absolutely . nick brazil : could i jump in there ? i 've got to jump in there as , from the institution i 'm in , we 've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities . about 20 per cent of our learners go to russell group universities , and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those , they do not value the welsh bac . but if they do offer an option with the welsh bac , they say it is on top of three a2-level grades . so , obviously , we 've had that track record . i think the seren programme that 's been put in by the welsh government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses , but you look through the range , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects as well , across a number and range of universities , the welsh bac is always added as the additional one . so , bear in mind , then , that welsh students are fighting for places against scottish , northern irish and , potentially , english students who are studying three subjects , whereas our welsh students potentially could be doing three a2s , three a-level subjects plus the welsh bac . and , as we talked about earlier on , the welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they 're trying to get possibly three a* grades . so , i think we need to consider that . in relation to the first answer , it is variable , and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions , and also make the decision dependent on whether it 's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject , which the russell group report indicates about facilitating subjects , and welsh bac at the moment is not a facilitating subject . i think it 's got to , extending on what kay says— . it 's got to be— . you know , it is comparable , as long as it 's right for that learner 's future . if it 's right for the learner 's future , absolutely it 's comparable . but if a learner wants to go into a particular sector and the welsh bac is not accepted , it 's not comparable . but , then , if it is into a certain sector and the skills are being developed in the right manner for that sector , absolutely . but it 's got to be right for the learner . ed evans : can i give perhaps an employer 's perspective on that , which might be completely wrong , but it 's been interesting listening to what 's been said here ? about a year ago , we bought the wjec in to speak to our employers , or a number of them , just to explain to them what the welsh bac was about—back to listening and about understanding , really , and it just was not there at all . i could see that most of the employers there were really impressed with it once they understood what it was about and they saw the opportunities at a whole host of levels . we 've kind of gone into an university discussion here , but there are school leavers leaving at 16 or 18. the skills that they bring having gone through this process i think most of the employers could get , at least in my sector , they could understand— ' i can see what that person can do . ' but we 've also seen it from university-educated people as well . they are a little bit too focused on the academic side of things . those that bring a little bit of world experience , a little bit of the welsh bac-type of things , just become far more rounded and useful people . i can understand why there 's a certain obsession , almost , with the academic side of it , but i think we lose that vocational bit at our peril , and to a certain extent we probably have n't got it in many quarters anyway . so , for me , the welsh bac helps to build that . call it something else maybe , but that 's what it should do . dr rachel bowen : i think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent , inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance . that whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we 've discussed , that 's a real positive . the chances are that we 've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification . the approach is a positive one . i think it 's perfectly possible for learners to reach fe college having attained the welsh bac under the process that you 've described , and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see . nick brazil : can i just add something to that ? i think ed 's just said about the softer skills . do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification ? i think kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college . we run programmes as well . they 're not qualifications , but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills . so , i think we 're all in agreement about the development of the skills , but does it need to be through a qualification ? lynne neagle am : and you 've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner . are you aware , then , of any young people who are coming to you from the swansea area because they 've got that flexibility , which they may not have in one of the local schools ? nick brazil : as i said , in terms of our offer , we offer a range in the curriculum . we 're not going out there saying , 'come to us for this particular reason . ' sian gwenllian am : that 's a question . kay martin : can i just mention as well that there 's a bigger job in helping parents to understand that the only qualifications in the world are not a-levels ? perhaps you might want to do an engineering btec programme , or you might want to do a health and social care , or you might want to do hospitality . you might want to do btec programmes , you can still go to university if that 's what you want to do , or you can go into an apprenticeship afterwards , and selling that whole range to parents , because there is an overemphasis , by us all , on a-levels— . dafydd evans : i 'm not assured in terms of—yes , training is required regarding the welsh bac , but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board . when we were bringing lecturers from outside—'welsh bac specialists ' in inverted commas—it was not working well . it has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum . therefore , no , i think that if it 's going to be a success , it 's got to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and we 've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the welsh bac— . it 's been an intensive staff development process . ed evans : i was just going to add there , really , if you want to raise the profile amongst parents in particular , if you 've got that far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this— . apologies , i 'd almost forgotten that we were in the colegau thing , i was thinking 'schools ' actually [ laughter . ] but in terms of bringing those businesses into schools in a structured way , not an ad-hoc way , which is just a friend turning up to talk about something , a structured way— . we have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum ' in the sector that we hope to roll out . now , if that was rolled out across the board—i 'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular , but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled , global areas , because it 's not their bag . so , bring in some experts , bring in some business , raise the profile , and i think then , possibly , you 'll start to get parents thinking , 'actually , there is something more to this than just the academic bit .

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> project manager : alright we 're moving on to conceptual design . um , i 'll just review what we did in our last meeting . um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and um , yeah . that was generally how helpful that was . and why not wood ? marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . for fashion , we go for fashion . uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? user interface : mm-hmm . i actually was n't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh so so okay , let me get this right . okay , uh okay , alright anyway . um here we go . conceptual user interface . trying we 're gon na try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . project manager : oh we s had n't discussed it last time . user interface : 'cause if we 're gon na have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel industrial designer : you need a screen with music because you 're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . with tv channels it 's , you know , one two three . so project manager : we 're , um , we 're actually not having d_v_d_ , marketing : that correct ? user interface : so that people seems to be well industrial designer : it 's more expensive according to the design people . user interface : yeah , that 's the only thing though . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : to user interface : yeah , well we do n't want the screen i guess , but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but i dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . i mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your yeah . or your thumb or something . so yeah , but , i mean , do you need that ? if if you can get to , you know if so long as you 're able to bring up the menu on the tv screen . project manager : yeah i mean i guess that 's the thing so i guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that 's user interface : mean industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : i mean you can do it , marketing : they already do it . industrial designer : i 'm not sure . well user interface : so , um but i mean it 's i 've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . and i do n't think that should uh that should be too hard . yeah . yeah . well so so , do we need i dunno . well i guess we have to you know think about but i mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : that 's what it does anyway . marketing : and i never get it . never ever . well on the telly . project manager : mm . and it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the user interface : um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so marketing : that 's quite interesting . what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i 'm dreading ? project manager : yeah . i mean definitely the area round it . user interface : but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you 're like we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like industrial designer : you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . project manager : um i mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we 've just the feedback we 've just got about the i was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that 's your actual thing . user interface : yeah . project manager : 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy industrial designer : and then it has a mm-hmm . user interface : it 's like it has to be s what if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you 're saying the squishy part 's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing marketing : well just a li i ca n't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . but well the question is , which one 's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah . so where are the fruit and vegetables now ? fruits and veg . marketing : we we do n't know . mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : well i dunno . you 'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . then you 'd get a new one and you 'd have to do it all over again . marketing : i do n't know . project manager : i do n't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . components concept . question mark . energy . question mark . industrial designer : that was me . so i sort of picked battery . project manager : what does everyone else think ? marketing : do n't know the cost . industrial designer : did n't have enough data to actually all it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . it did n't give me any actual cost . most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . so i do n't think it 's that much of a problem . like the chip is probably the most expensive part . case is what we were discussing yeah . project manager : um let 's see . is there anything else we need to talk about ? oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . and you 're gon na be doing protu product evaluation . so you 'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . </s>
<s> what did the group discuss about the current trend and potential materials ? </s> user interface : 'scuse me . project manager : um , i 'll just review what we did in our last meeting . um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and um , yeah . that was generally how helpful that was . um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , uh , we have n't concluded but we 're right , um so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you 've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? industrial designer : sure . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so i 've been looking at the components design . um . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we 'll just use standard . um , i assume we 'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . and we 'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . but once we come up with a design we 'll send it to the circuit people and they 'll just print it out . um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel . the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gon na be included in the circuit board that comes with it . um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . so we have some material options . um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . um , i 'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy . um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we should n't have a rubber case . project manager : and why not wood ? and why not wood ? industrial designer : hmm ? uh , well we can use wood . i do n't know why we 'd want to . um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . we ca n't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . i do n't think it 's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . so that 's what i 've got on design . project manager : 's good . marketing : um , can i do next ? 'cause i have to say something about the material industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : which is quite shocking . industrial designer : marketing : ha . mm . right , um , i have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . um . next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . and th last thing is the easy to use um factor . um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use . um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend project manager : marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . for fashion , we go for fashion . the fashion in electronics . so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . and also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer . as to the material should be limited to i do n't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , i do n't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that 's the way to go . um . i i have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and i prefer fruits to vegetables , uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? um , and finally again with the spongy . it has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that 's better than mine . um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter . user interface : mm-hmm . oh , uh , there we go . uh . okay . um . well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . i actually was n't aware of the new trends in electronics marketing : neither was i . well it 's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics . user interface : so so okay , let me get this right . okay , uh okay , alright anyway . um here we go . conceptual user interface . trying we 're gon na try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . industrial designer : you need a screen with music because you 're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . with tv channels it 's , you know , one two three . so project manager : i i meant to update you on that . um . user interface : alright . okay . so anyway if well we just we need to okay so if we 're not gon na have a screen i think i was thinking okay . so basically it 's just gon na be a wheel then ? and you 're just gon na i mean i think you 're gon na have to have some kind of a right . so that people seems to be well you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or industrial designer : my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the tv . user interface : 'cause you 'll have to like industrial designer : but i think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , user interface : and then there 's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wan na change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , i do n't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , industrial designer : it 's more expensive according to the design people . user interface : yeah , that 's the only thing though . industrial designer : you have to get a an advanced chip if you wan na have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . mm-hmm . marketing : you can just take theirs and just user interface : but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but i dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . yeah . or your thumb or something . so project manager : what if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you do n't use very much ? like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? so the options are there but they 're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . user interface : that keeps it my i 've never bought just a remote , like , so i do n't i do n't really know . so , um but i mean it 's i 've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . and i do n't think that should uh that should be too hard . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : that 's what it does anyway . marketing : well on the telly . project manager : mm . and it is technologically innovative in a way , marketing : that 's quite interesting . what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i 'm dreading ? industrial designer : oh , i was gon na say . you said uh people want spongy . one of the material options is a sort of rubber that 's in like those stress ball things . so , that would be spongy . marketing : just nice feel , but i hate spongy . user interface : we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like industrial designer : you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . project manager : and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that 's on there . user interface : unfortunately they do n't have silver fruits and vegetables . project manager : i mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we 've just the feedback we 've just got about the marketing : a relaxing squashy ball . that you can p well i see you 're thinking , it 's weird , you 're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you 're thinking you change the the hard bit oh , okay , yeah . yeah i was thinking of getting a cover for well i do n't know if it 's cheaper actually . project manager : 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy user interface : what if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you 're saying the squishy part 's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing marketing : well just a li i ca n't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . but well the question is , which one 's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , user interface : yeah . so where are the fruit and vegetables now ? industrial designer : i guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . project manager : i do n't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . industrial designer : that was me . project manager : okay . oh right right . yeah . um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? i mean we 're gon na use batteries right ? and industrial designer : uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , marketing : oh , a dynamo is ah , it 's a bicycle . it 's a bicycle mechanism . it 's the en it 's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . industrial designer : so i sort of picked battery . we could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . um but i think solar power 's not available with the rubber case anyways . project manager : i think batteries sound good . what about kryptonite ? marketing : which is quite cool . so if you throw it , it 's gon na store loads of energy , and you do n't need to buy a battery 'cause they 're quite f i find them annoying . but we need to find cost . industrial designer : did n't have enough data to actually all it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . it did n't give me any actual cost . most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . so i do n't think it 's that much of a problem . like the chip is probably the most expensive part . um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too i think . um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . </s>
<s> what did the industrial designer say about component design ? </s> user interface : 'scuse me . project manager : um , i 'll just review what we did in our last meeting . um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and um , yeah . that was generally how helpful that was . um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , uh , we have n't concluded but we 're right , um so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you 've come from our last time . does everyone have presentations ? okay . industrial designer : sure . project manager : okay . industrial designer : so i 've been looking at the components design . um . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we 'll just use standard . um , i assume we 'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . and we 'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . but once we come up with a design we 'll send it to the circuit people and they 'll just print it out . um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel . the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gon na be included in the circuit board that comes with it . um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . so we have some material options . um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . um , i 'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it 's really heavy . um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we should n't have a rubber case . project manager : and why not wood ? and why not wood ? industrial designer : hmm ? uh , well we can use wood . i do n't know why we 'd want to . um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . we ca n't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . i do n't think it 's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . so that 's what i 've got on design . project manager : 's good . marketing : um , can i do next ? 'cause i have to say something about the material industrial designer : user interface : yeah . marketing : which is quite shocking . industrial designer : marketing : ha . mm . right , um , i have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . um . next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . and th last thing is the easy to use um factor . um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use . um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend project manager : user interface : project manager : industrial designer : marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . for fashion , we go for fashion . industrial designer : user interface : project manager : industrial designer : project manager : industrial designer : user interface : i actually was n't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh but like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay . so , b you you 're gon na have to switch to like d_v_d_ and like other things like that , are n't you ? okay . project manager : i i meant to update you on that . um . industrial designer : user interface : alright . okay . okay . okay . so anyway if well we just we need to okay so if we 're not gon na have a screen i think i was thinking okay . so basically it 's just gon na be a wheel then ? and you 're just gon na i mean i think you 're gon na have to have some kind of a right . so that people seems to be well marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or industrial designer : my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the tv . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : but i think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , user interface : yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you i mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um so you 're either you 're you know , th you 're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth project manager : right . user interface : and then there 's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wan na change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , i do n't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen 's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you 're not really using it , that 's kind of industrial designer : it 's more expensive according to the design people . user interface : yeah , that 's the only thing though . industrial designer : you have to get a an advanced chip if you wan na have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . user interface : you can get to you know , you can like maybe it 'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the tv and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the project manager : so the tv is the screen , that yeah okay . marketing : you can just take theirs and just user interface : but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but i dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . project manager : um , and you just have this , it 's like just a long silver thing , user interface : that keeps it you it 's it does n't seem that hard . i mean i 've never bought a remote . industrial designer : well they usually are . user interface : my i 've never bought just a remote , like , so i do n't i do n't really know . so , um but i mean it 's i 've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . and i do n't think that should uh that should be too hard . yeah . yeah . well so so , do we need i dunno . well i guess we have to you know think about but i mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . project manager : yeah . okay . user interface : that 's what it does anyway . marketing : and i never get it . user interface : on the telly , okay , yeah . so yeah i think , i mean , i think i think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea project manager : mm . and it is technologically innovative in a way , marketing : that 's quite interesting . what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i 'm dreading ? industrial designer : um , one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that 's in like those stress ball things . so , that would be spongy . user interface : we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like project manager : is that kind of marketing : a relaxing squashy ball . that you can p well i do n't know if it 's cheaper actually . project manager : i was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that 's your actual thing . user interface : it 's like it has to be s project manager : yeah , i know what you meant , yeah . industrial designer : so i sort of picked battery . we could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . um but i think solar power 's not available with the rubber case anyways . project manager : what about kryptonite ? marketing : okay . right . </s>
<s> what did people decide on screen usage when discussing the necessity of screen ? </s> marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . for fashion , we go for fashion . but that 's just a personal opinion . user interface : and and uh project manager : yeah but you 're not gon na wear your remote control . user interface : 'cause if we 're gon na have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel you it seems like you would need a screen . industrial designer : you need a screen with music because you 're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . with tv channels it 's , you know , one two three . so user interface : but like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay . so , b you you 're gon na have to switch to like d_v_d_ and like other things like that , are n't you ? project manager : we 're , um , we 're actually not having d_v_d_ , user interface : yeah like you 're gon na have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we 're not choosing that , i guess . but like choose channel control , like if you wa because people are n't gon na be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . so that people seems to be well project manager : you 've yeah , i know what you 're saying , you have to user interface : you know . but you 're gon na have to scroll to get channels . so um i guess that 's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just i guess i c i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the tv like what channel you 're on . you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or project manager : but i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to user interface : 'cause you 'll have to like but you can quickly s you can marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth and then there 's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wan na change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , i do n't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , project manager : yeah i mean with that many options , you 'd uh i 'd think that the screen would be better , user interface : like project manager : because you could have that menu option , sort of user interface : i would think so too , like so i mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen 's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you 're not really using it , that 's kind of yeah , that 's the only thing though . yeah . so then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you 're doing , um you can get to you know , you can like maybe it 'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the tv marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the project manager : so the tv is the screen , that yeah user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : so it would have all these different options of changing to marketing : on the you can just take theirs and just user interface : yeah , well we do n't want the screen i guess , but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but i dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . so project manager : um , right . what if i mean , if you 're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , user interface : it does n't seem that you would need anything besides pow i mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the tv . like , i think we 're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir i 'm f i 'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . i mean it it needs to be easy to project manager : but , were there buttons on there as well ? what if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you do n't use very much ? like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? so the options are there but they 're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . user interface : but ca n't you just get project manager : do do you know what i 'm talking about though ? like , uh , yeah just something marketing : well you can have it on the settings , user interface : yeah , but , i mean , do you need that ? if if you can get to , you know if so long as you 're able to bring up the menu on the tv screen . that keeps it project manager : yeah , yeah . user interface : mean industrial designer : oh how they make the menu show up on the tv ? well they usually are . well user interface : my i 've never bought just a remote , like , so i do n't i do n't really know . so , um but i mean it 's i 've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . and i do n't think that should uh that should be too hard . industrial designer : yeah , it most of the ones we 've had have had the menu button , 'cause it 's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'cause it just does n't come up every day or something . user interface : yeah . yeah . well so so , do we need i dunno . well i guess we have to you know think about but i mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . that 's what it does anyway . marketing : but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you 're supposed to understand , user interface : oh , you mean if we have this screen like the ipod screen ? industrial designer : or on the tv too . user interface : on the telly , okay , yeah . so yeah i think , i mean , i think i think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now i hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you 're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . project manager : mm . and it is technologically innovative in a way , user interface : yeah . i guess . and it is trendy , the ipods are really hot right now , so mm . we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like project manager : so what if what user interface : so i think project manager : and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that 's on there . um marketing : and i 'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um sticker sort of ? because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a project manager : that see i was thinking this s i was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that 's your actual thing . 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy user interface : it 's like it has to be s project manager : yeah , i know what you meant , yeah . user interface : and you could get you could have your choice , you know ? marketing : but well the question is , which one 's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and user interface : yeah . i mean i think uh and i think the handhe i think the handheld part is definitely so you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . project manager : yeah , th and that would that industrial designer : it it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . marketing : okay . right . </s>

and why not wood ? industrial designer : hmm ? uh , well we can use wood . i do n't know why we 'd want to . um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it 's gon na require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . we ca n't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . i do n't think it 's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . so that 's what i 've got on design . project manager : 's good . user interface : yeah . marketing : and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . for fashion , we go for fashion . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah but you 're not gon na wear your remote control . oh we s had n't discussed it last time . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah like you 're g project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : so that people seems to be well project manager : you 've yeah , i know what you 're saying , you have to industrial designer : yeah . user interface : you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or marketing : yeah , yeah . user interface : 'cause you 'll have to like marketing : yeah . industrial designer : they have to r wheel really fast . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen 's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you 're not really using it , that 's kind of project manager : yeah . industrial designer : it 's more expensive according to the design people . user interface : m yeah . yeah , that 's the only thing though . industrial designer : you have to get a an advanced chip if you wan na have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah . project manager : yeah . marketing : you can just take theirs and just project manager : yeah . user interface : but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but i dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . yeah . project manager : um , and you just have this , it 's like just a long silver thing , marketing : yeah but should be comfortable . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : that keeps it industrial designer : i 'm not sure . mm-hmm . project manager : yeah . okay . user interface : that 's what it does anyway . marketing : well on the telly . project manager : mm . and it is technologically innovative in a way , marketing : that 's quite interesting . what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i 'm dreading ? industrial designer : one of the material options is a sort of rubber that 's in like those stress ball things . so , that would be spongy . user interface : oh , okay , that would be cool . marketing : just nice feel , but i hate spongy . user interface : we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like yeah . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : well i do n't know if it 's cheaper actually . user interface : it 's like it has to be s yeah . project manager : yeah , i know what you meant , yeah . user interface : what if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you 're saying the squishy part 's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ? marketing : well just a li i ca n't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : especially if you 're switching out the squishy part . then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . project manager : okay . oh right right . yeah . um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? i mean we 're gon na use batteries right ? and industrial designer : uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , marketing : oh , a dynamo is ah , it 's a bicycle . it 's a bicycle mechanism . it 's the en it 's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . industrial designer : so i sort of picked battery . we could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . um but i think solar power 's not available with the rubber case anyways . project manager : i think batteries sound good . what about kryptonite ? marketing : which is quite cool . so if you throw it , it 's gon na store loads of energy , and you do n't need to buy a battery 'cause they 're quite f i find them annoying . but we need to find cost . industrial designer : all it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . it did n't give me any actual cost . most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . so i do n't think it 's that much of a problem . like the chip is probably the most expensive part . um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , project manager : uh-huh . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> user interface : our beautiful drawing . project manager : so just f um so this is our agenda . you 're f you 're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . user interface : okay yeah . well then then we 're gon na put it in . yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh so you can make it very easy to use . 'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . project manager : yeah . okay . so this is okay ? but um okay , for the so i already calculated that and it 's still in the budget . so it 's okay . so you can show your prototype if you want to . user interface : together ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah , it 's let 's do it together . marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : just so you get that . user interface : yeah okay , just we just missed that . so when you pre yeah . project manager : how do you want to implement that ? just on the maybe on the second level as well ? user interface : we 're going to implement . yeah . mm just a little project manager : okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . marketing : that function must be yeah , maybe or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . project manager : for the bottom . industrial designer : so what do we need ? extern or something . project manager : you want to save that file as well ? the drawing ? user interface : that was it . that 's yeah well we do n't have any uh industrial designer : okay . what else ? what else ? marketing : yeah , to navigate . industrial designer : like a normal um marketing : okay , yeah . th yeah . industrial designer : so did we miss anything ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : okay . yeah , or th or the marketing : the sta the state you project manager : oh just three stages , you industrial designer : through view . user interface : yeah , the three stages . yes . marketing : mm . that 's maybe one thing we can discuss about . user interface : the chip . so yeah . um do we need to fix that or marketing : mm most new tvs do uh collect all the pages . project manager : yeah ? okay , cool . mm mm mm mm mm . yeah , i do n't know what this means . but i think we just evela evaluated this one . marketing : yeah , i made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . um model . and this these are all i i i found , or i wrote down . and um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . user interface : okay . well i think we do marketing : uh because um user interface : it 's hard to decide for us , but yeah . mm . not needed . project manager : that as well , yeah . yeah , but that 's unnecessary . user interface : what do i think is necessary necessary item ? marketing : then we do it . user interface : yeah , w we 've done a a lot of detail in light , so project manager : this is a difficult one , because we we do n't yeah , we do n't know it about the marketing : learnable ? easy to use ? yeah , we shall test it but uh industrial designer : that 's th that 's the main thing that 's so good about it . user interface : so i think it 's easy to use , but and learnable is a bit industrial designer : well , i think it is . project manager : but the rest of it is very easy , user interface : yeah , i think it 's very clear what it all does . marketing : yeah . but we we 've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . industrial designer : mm uh . the normal . marketing : new features . techno technological innovative ? okay , and the the the lightning ? so we have a pretty new uh it 's it 's it 's not not lcd or something . project manager : yeah , just draw it afterwards . user interface : i do n't know . industrial designer : i think it is . user interface : yeah , it is . industrial designer : no , i think it is . user interface : yeah , it does n't matter . save . marketing : uh all the the seven , uh all the seven . no , we are not extraordinary new or something . tha tha that project manager : targeted audience . uh we are the targeted audience ? do we like it ? marketing : no , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . project manager : yeah , but l younger than forty . so we we are exactly the targeted group . marketing : yes . yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? th that 's my question . um the only point is that we do n't uh have uh uh that 's that 's that 's this question . yeah , this . so we targeted it ? but we did n't follow the latest trends . tha these are the only latest uh trends i uh get on my computer . uh yeah , th so we had we uh have uh a fruit uh so we give ourself a three or something . project manager : yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . so that 's both . industrial designer : but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or marketing : so we are user interface : okay , then we then we need to use it . industrial designer : it 's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . because project manager : okay , so this is uh pretty much it this . so i just want you yeah , we just made it . so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . okay . we can do some discussion about this . was there room for creativity ? paul , was there room for crea creativity ? user interface : i think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . so marketing : yeah . we could make a lot of different uh remote controls . project manager : okay , so the leadership was there a leadership and what do you have to say about that ? user interface : yeah . industrial designer : one leader or something . user interface : one leader to check the time , etcetera . so more like a secretary . project manager : uh team work um the the third meeting i think that one was pretty hard . we were not all we were not um agree with every not agree with . marketing : yeah yeah . we were not finished . industrial designer : yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just project manager : we 're not finished . user interface : like uh the prices . if we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . we had to project manager : yeah , finance . but the teamwork was okay . marketing : yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . and uh user interface : i think uh everyone listen to each other . like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . just not work too slow . marketing : precise . user interface : not just pointing out on it . industrial designer : just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . user interface : you cou you could draw on it , but not as main function . we did it . new ideas found . marketing : new ideas . to gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for project manager : no , for the project . yeah . but it 's for the next team . we do n't have to do that . user interface : that 's for . yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the industrial designer : yeah , just brainstorming basically . project manager : yes , i think just i just write a final report . user interface : so that was it . industrial designer : we 're probably not supposed to look at this , but user interface : yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . well , leader ? project manager ? i knew it . i do n't agree . industrial designer : and what else do we have ? marketing : 'kay wait , i 'm going to draw something and you must y user interface : no , not everything . industrial designer : yeah , everything . user interface : that 's a kinda big mistake . warning , finish meeting now . guys , i think we have to finish the meeting . marketing : 'kay this is a hard one . industrial designer : fill in the questionnaire . what now ? no more chit-chat . </s>

'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . because easy to use comes after learnable . project manager : okay , just easy to use is very cool , marketing : i i think it a three or something . project manager : so just give it a two . user interface : maybe three then . learnable 's project manager : no , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . user interface : yep , true . then a two . marketing : new features . techno technological innovative ? project manager : slide is not n is is not new . no . i already have a marketing : okay . project manager : so that 's not new . user interface : okay . marketing : is that new ? industrial designer : mm it 's pretty new , i think . project manager : there are no games on it , that 's that 's it 's not a one , it 's a two again . marketing : it 's it 's it 's not not lcd or something . user interface : we do n't industrial designer : well it 's a already in the folder . l like number seven . i think it is . user interface : yeah , it is . industrial designer : no , i think it is . okay . marketing : uh all the the seven , uh all the seven . project manager : okay . and new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? no , i think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . but not no , just so it 's still a two . industrial designer : mm two , i think . project manager : targeted audience . uh we are the targeted audience ? do we like it ? marketing : no , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . project manager : yeah , but l younger than forty . so we we are exactly the targeted group . marketing : yes . yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? project manager : i think so , yeah . marketing : th that 's my question . project manager : you get the fancy things for younger people . and you get the the aesthetic things for older people . industrial designer : think that 's a two or a one . marketing : um the only point is that we do n't uh have uh uh that 's that 's that 's this question . so we targeted it ? but we did n't follow the latest trends . user interface : mm . i think we followed the latest trends . industrial designer : a front that 's that 's like uh like a banana , or something . marketing : oh yeah . but spongy will never be . so we give ourself a three or something . okay . what 's the average ? industrial designer : eleven divided by six . project manager : yeah , it is one point eight three . marketing : a perfect score . no , i do n't know . industrial designer : we 're not too hard on ourselves . project manager : okay . marketing : that 's fine . project manager : so that 's both . marketing : come on , it 's perfect . uh twelve point three point three . project manager : see it 's i think it 's okay like this . industrial designer : yeah , it 's four . marketing : four . it 's four euros . okay . user interface : okay . industrial designer : yeah m if we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity project manager : okay . marketing : who was the leader ? yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , i think . user interface : yeah , more accurate . yeah , it 's i it should be more accurate . not just pointing out on it . project manager : okay . i think yeah , okay . industrial designer : it 's now quarter past three . so project manager : okay . user interface : one two three four five six seven cameras . mm not bad . then an lcd uh would be handy . i do agree with that . yeah , tu-dum . english is not so hard by the way . you do ? yeah , you have to make a choice . marketing : yes . no it 's your choice . just pick one . user interface : you have to decide . it 's the lower one . marketing : i knew it . four in a row . user interface : come on . marketing : okay . yeah , then i put it there . no one wins . industrial designer : well it has a lcd , i think . marketing : okay . industrial designer : and what else do we have ? marketing : okay , blank . industrial designer : yeah , everything . user interface : okay . it 's a house . a plant ? oh yeah , i can know it . it 's a okay , that makes it easier . i think i know . no , wrong . marketing : it 's very user interface : you 're correct . industrial designer : okay . marketing : 'kay this is a hard one . industrial designer : okay . marketing : okay . che-che-che-che . </s>
<s> what 's the conclusion on the discussion about the criteria of ease of use and learnable ? </s> industrial designer : oh , okay . yeah . project manager : okay , but it 's still possible uh uh financially . so if you want to , it 's okay . slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . maybe that 's better . yeah , that 's that 's a very good point . industrial designer : think that 's better . user interface : so you can make it very easy to use . 'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . industrial designer : ah okay . project manager : so i already calculated that and it 's still in the budget . so it 's okay . so you can show your prototype if you want to . user interface : speech recognition . um i did n't have a specification of that . but um i can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . industrial designer : yeah , or or on the slide function , i do n't know . project manager : okay . marketing : okay . user interface : we also do n't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open . you yeah i know . i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . so but it 's enough room . well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . that was the the most important thing . so uh the best place , the best reach place um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . that way you do n't have to make it red , 'cause it 's will uh will show up . uh scrollwheel is on the left side . it 's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as i know . industrial designer : yeah . but it 's not uh impossible to use it , if you 're left handed . so y because you can use your thumb then . user interface : yeah . marketing : just just one thing now . um y you need to have more uh one two th you 've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . but you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . industrial designer : mm yeah . yeah , okay . just so you get that . marketing : okay , but it 's rather important . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but um i 'll just uh i 'll get back to later . f the form well , we 've taken that from the ipod , other popular technical device . so um should be popular . um the f uh the buttons creating ? uh if you that or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . project manager : and do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? how do you want to implement that ? just on the maybe on the second level as well ? okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : okay , there is one uh function i use uh daily , and it 's not on the basic functions . it 's uh to switch to uh uh your scart . play station or uh d_v_d_ player . that function must be yeah , maybe or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . industrial designer : yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . user interface : the menu button , yes . well we do n't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . so you ca n't redesign it . marketing : okay , yeah . th yeah . it some text uh buttons . there 's one there 's one text button i project manager : yeah , that 's okay . marketing : it it does n't uh uh clear the the page . if you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? industrial designer : okay , okay . project manager : that 's a functionality for the television . marketing : mm . that 's maybe one thing we can discuss about . industrial designer : yeah mm nee uh no , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . th th th if you switch it on . user interface : yeah , in thi the the remote control in the project manager : that 's what what happening if you do it like that . but it 's still the television that has to do that . marketing : because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh and maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? well yeah . that 's too much place . okay , just leave it . just leave it . project manager : yeah ? okay , cool . mm mm mm mm mm . yeah , i do n't know what this means . but i think we just evela evaluated this one . oh okay , you made some criteria . okay , cool . okay . marketing : i d d d i do n't think if it 's right . that shall show it . project manager : you have some usability criteria or okay . industrial designer : in the bottom . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , evaluation is project manager : okay . marketing : um model . project manager : okay . marketing : and this these are all i i i found , or i wrote down . and um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . project manager : uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea . it quite beautiful . it 's marketing : yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the ipod or something . and fancy 's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . user interface : okay . well i think we do if it 's really uh , if you can if you can get the ipod look , then it 's beautiful , i think . project manager : yeah , just give it a one . it 's okay . user interface : it 's hard to decide for us , but yeah . it it 's at least it 's a lot better than uh current remote controls . project manager : okay , just give it a two . marketing : yeah . a two . okay . the fancy look-and-feel . that 's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . project manager : that as well , yeah . marketing : it 's pretty cool . if you slide it open , it lights up . that 's that 's really fancy , but i do n't know if it 's reachable . user interface : of course it 's reachable . project manager : yeah , this it is a one . it 's okay . it 's cool . marketing : i think it 's one . okay , next . project manager : this is a difficult one , because we we do n't yeah , we do n't know it about the marketing : learnable ? easy to use ? yeah , we shall test it but uh project manager : uh it 's it 's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . industrial designer : and you on do n't have to pay attention to that second layer . user interface : so i think it 's easy to use , but and learnable is a bit marketing : learnable ? it 's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . industrial designer : well , i think it is . marketing : i think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or uh then the re user interface : yeah , i think it 's very clear what it all does . industrial designer : so so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . user interface : but the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . project manager : so it is learnable um f i i in the first place it 's very easy to use . user interface : it 's yeah it 's project manager : and i think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . marketing : yeah . but we we 've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . because easy to use comes after learnable . project manager : okay , just easy to use is very cool , marketing : i i think it a three or something . project manager : so just give it a two . industrial designer : mm uh . the normal . user interface : yep , true . then a two . marketing : new features . techno technological innovative ? uh i only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . project manager : uh i already have a v_c_r_ and it 's about from nineteen eighty eight . and they all have a slide in it . so that 's not new . that 's cool . marketing : it 's it 's it 's not not lcd or something . industrial designer : i think it is . user interface : yeah , it is . industrial designer : no , i think it is . marketing : uh all the the seven , uh all the seven . project manager : okay . and new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? no , i think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . but not no , just so it 's still a two . industrial designer : mm two , i think . marketing : tha tha that project manager : targeted audience . uh we are the targeted audience ? do we like it ? marketing : no , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . project manager : yeah , but l younger than forty . so we we are exactly the targeted group . marketing : yes . yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? th that 's my question . project manager : you get the fancy things for younger people . and you get the the aesthetic things for older people . industrial designer : we 've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that 's what attracts the young audience . so think that 's a two or a one . yeah , but s it that 's basically not not handy . and i do n't thi i do n't see yeah . marketing : so we targeted it ? but we did n't follow the latest trends . user interface : mm . i think we followed the latest trends . industrial designer : a front that 's that 's like uh like a banana , or something . user interface : yes uh . industrial designer : mm okay . marketing : that 's fine . project manager : so that 's both . marketing : come on , it 's perfect . uh twelve point three point three . industrial designer : but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or project manager : no , that 's not on the list . but that should n't be . see it 's i think it 's okay like this . marketing : yeah . we could make a lot of different uh remote controls . yeah . user interface : i think uh everyone listen to each other . project manager : yeah .

'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . project manager : no , you have a different chip for speech recognition . so so i already calculated that and it 's still in the budget . so it 's okay . so you can show your prototype if you want to . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , it 's let 's do it together . project manager : okay , cool . okay . industrial designer : well we have n't had time to design that , the slide pad . marketing : okay . user interface : we also do n't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open . you yeah i know . i can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . so but it 's enough room . uh well industrial designer : you wrote this , so . user interface : well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . that was the the most important thing . industrial designer : yeah . but it 's not uh impossible to use it , if you 're left handed . so y because you can use your thumb then . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , okay . just so you get that . marketing : okay , but it 's rather important . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but um i 'll just uh i 'll get back to later . f the form well , we 've taken that from the ipod , other popular technical device . so um should be popular . um the f uh the buttons creating ? uh if you that or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . project manager : and do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? how do you want to implement that ? just on the maybe on the second level as well ? okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . user interface : yeah . marketing : and h how does the second level come out ? it 's a f basic uh user interface : yeah , the three stages . yes . marketing : it it does n't uh uh clear the the page . if you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? industrial designer : okay , okay . marketing : but maybe it 's not the way industrial designer : yeah mm nee uh no , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . th th th if you switch it on . user interface : yeah , in thi the the remote control in the marketing : well yeah . that 's too much place . project manager : yeah ? okay , cool . mm mm mm mm mm . yeah , i do n't know what this means . but i think we just evela evaluated this one . oh okay , you made some criteria . okay , cool . okay . marketing : i d d d i do n't think if it 's right . that shall show it . project manager : you have some usability criteria or marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : okay . marketing : uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . uh industrial designer : in the bottom . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : no , evaluation is marketing : evaluation crit yeah , evaluation presentation . it 's not in . uh d it does n't matter um it only had two pages or something . um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . the italians uh , how they think about it . and the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . i made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our project manager : okay . marketing : um model . project manager : okay . marketing : and this these are all i i i found , or i wrote down . and um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . project manager : uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea . it quite beautiful . marketing : uh yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the ipod or something . and fancy 's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . user interface : okay . well i think we do if it 's really uh , if you can if you can get the ipod look , then it 's beautiful , i think . marketing : okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . project manager : yeah , just give it a one . it 's okay . okay , just give it a two . marketing : yeah . a two . okay . the fancy look-and-feel . that 's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . project manager : that as well , yeah . marketing : it 's pretty cool . if you slide it open , it lights up . that 's that 's really fancy , but i do n't know if it 's reachable . user interface : of course it 's reachable . project manager : yeah , this it is a one . marketing : i think it 's one . okay , next . learnable ? easy to use ? yeah , we shall test it but uh project manager : uh it 's it 's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . industrial designer : and you on do n't have to pay attention to that second layer . user interface : so i think it 's easy to use , but and learnable is a bit industrial designer : well , i think it is . marketing : uh then the re user interface : but the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . project manager : so it is learnable um f i i in the first place it 's very easy to use . user interface : it 's yeah it 's marketing : yeah . but we we 've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? 'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . because easy to use comes after learnable . project manager : okay , just easy to use is very cool , marketing : i i think it a three or something . project manager : so just give it a two . user interface : yep , true . then a two . marketing : new features . techno technological innovative ? project manager : so that 's not new . industrial designer : user interface : marketing : industrial designer : i think it is . user interface : yeah , it is . industrial designer : no , i think it is . project manager : okay . and new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? no , i think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . but not no , just so it 's still a two . industrial designer : mm two , i think . project manager : targeted audience . uh we are the targeted audience ? do we like it ? marketing : no , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . project manager : yeah , but l younger than forty . so we we are exactly the targeted group . marketing : yes . yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? th that 's my question . project manager : you get the fancy things for younger people . and you get the the aesthetic things for older people . industrial designer : we 've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that 's what attracts the young audience . so think that 's a two or a one . yeah , but s it that 's basically not not handy . and i do n't thi i do n't see yeah . marketing : so we targeted it ? but we did n't follow the latest trends . user interface : mm . i think we followed the latest trends . marketing : oh yeah . but spongy will never be . so we give ourself a three or something . what 's the average ? a perfect score . no , i do n't know . project manager : so i just got a financial um you s saved it or no . okay , let 's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . if i forgot anything , just say it to me . it just is a battery . yeah , there are some that they did n't mention , because recharge is not on the list . but okay . so i think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it 's twelve point three euros . industrial designer : mm okay . marketing : that 's fine . industrial designer : okay . project manager : so that 's both . marketing : come on , it 's perfect . uh twelve point three point three . industrial designer : but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or project manager : no , that 's not on the list . but that should n't be . industrial designer : can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? marketing : industrial designer : yeah , it 's four . marketing : four . it 's four euros . user interface : oh , them . is that uh included ? in the twelve euro or industrial designer : marketing : project manager : okay , so this is uh pretty much it this . marketing : so it 's creativity . yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty euros or something now . and then yeah . industrial designer : so we 're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . project manager : but the teamwork was okay . marketing : yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . and uh user interface : i think uh everyone listen to each other . like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . project manager : no , for the project . marketing : no , for the prototype . new ideas . industrial designer : yeah , just brainstorming basically . marketing : user interface : i do agree with that . yeah , tu-dum . english is not so hard by the way . marketing : i knew it . four in a row . user interface : no i w okay , i 'm not that whiny . but uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well . </s>

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> project manager : so let 's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . and we will have three presentations and we 'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we 'll close the decision . so i will first uh marketing : no y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager : technical accessoire ? yeah , why not . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : so the last uh concept is intelligent . we want uh we want our controller to be smart , project manager : okay . something else ? because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? industrial designer : one and project manager : yeah , we can yeah . yeah , but one other question . user interface : how much ? project manager : yeah . because i suppose we need to do research to have something working . user interface : no no we we d we we just are use um project manager : some some efficient . user interface : no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : 'cause it it have to be universal , project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation industrial designer : yeah but you know . the product the pro user interface : because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . industrial designer : if you have the language , you have to develop for each country . yeah , but for each country you have to do one , because uh the for example for se user interface : even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to project manager : seems to be quite complex . marketing : we have to take care of the twelve euros industrial designer : to talk to the to the tv maybe . project manager : you just want to interact with television . user interface : you use your command think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . user interface : we should have confidence in technology . industrial designer : yeah , we should . uh . marketing : no one would would be interested . user interface : yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts . so what 's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? there 's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? marketing : cause for example yeah . project manager : yeah , but uh we want so marketing : true . project manager : yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer : so , yeah . marketing : i mean , for example the goo y uh thi this i mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition project manager : let 's go to the industrial designer . maybe we 'll be able to take a decision after that , so . industrial designer : yeah , participant two um project manager : working ? industrial designer : yeah , working design , so this yeah so this is the described use user interface : it did did n't r receive it . did n't receive it . project manager : maybe you you record it somewhere else . user interface : participant one . participant one . industrial designer : oh . maybe i record recorded directly on the computer . project manager : uh . nope . marketing : i dunno if you remember what you had to say or user interface : yeah , maybe we can first come to project manager : no , i think it will be more interesting to start with uh you will had s some more information in i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um baba 's presentation . marketing : yeah , true . industrial designer : i s because i in my presentation i do n't have here with and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : and what tha what about the uh materials ? yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . mm-hmm . mm . industrial designer : and it can be interesting . and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion project manager : i dunno . i think we have only uh five minutes left . participant four ? functional requirements ? marketing : so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting . um user really really want a fancy look and feel . they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically now i if we look at fashion in general um okay . wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris yeah thi this is this would be like um okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : yeah . solar . project manager : so you think case . something spongy . someth no wood . marketing : yeah , maybe the base . project manager : it 's it 's natural . industrial designer : uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested yeah , lcd . project manager : simple ones ? and i sup i think we 'll have to evaluate th the product too . and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . no more questions , we can close the session . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about the user interface design . </s> project manager : i 'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . user interface : if you 're okay . no . there this is the three concepts of our controller . project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , i think they will be bored after a while . you do n't think so ? user interface : uh i think some time it 's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . for example , if you can not find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . one and project manager : yeah , but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . user interface : so you can use your gesture . that 's no problem . project manager : yeah , but suppose you have a family watching tv , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface : yeah , that 's that 's the advantage of intelligent controller . even you h you have the controller , i can i can say channel three , so it 's c come to channel three , industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager : yeah , but one other question . user interface : no no we we d we we just are use um marketing : uh if you if if you use the basic user interface : yeah , i think it 's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it 's very project manager : yeah , but uh uh user interface : no it 's uh even for the f um because the the vocabulary the project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : no , it 's not so complex . project manager : and where will be they ? do you think if we 're far from television it will work ? user interface : no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . project manager : yeah , but we 're marketing : no , but then it 's it 's like this uh project manager : yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer : i if you say one , he switch to channel , user interface : and you do s your gesture . project manager : but you can lose it . user interface : no no it 's n y if you lose it industrial designer : so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the tv to switch to channel one . project manager : and put it on tv and just to recognize gestures and voice . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : but you would still have the buttons . or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? user interface : think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think you can see they can switch form one modality to another . project manager : hmm . so , what do you think ? we 'll try the controllers you 'd prefer . which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . you think it 's possible ? user interface : would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that industrial designer : we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . but uh i think a user need user interface : yeah , you y that 's a fun that 's not the function of the controller , that 's a function of tv . you can replace your tv with a new tv with internet browsing function , marketing : but you need you need new remote controller then . because if you wan na browse internet or , i do n't know , if you wan na type something , user interface : but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . industrial designer : because the p the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing : cause for example yeah . user interface : yeah , but we do we do we we we can not rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . that 's marketing : i mean , for example the goo y industrial designer : because you have new marketing : you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . marketing : uh thi this i mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface : but the there 's there 's n there 's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there 's no key feature in the new controller . marketing : yeah . i mean , i i know it 's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . i mean , that 's the point . industrial designer : of the remote control . so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager : yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . and what about the buttons ? industrial designer : i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . i think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the lcd buttons so . but and it is a kind of other design , i mean . it can also be interesting to have this kind of marketing : but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . okay , yeah . marketing : we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . and the other point i have n't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe does n't really fit with the wooden design . industrial designer : yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing : plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . yeah , so when i think it 's industrial designer : it will be a project manager : because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer : and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . but and the problem is i i 'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the tv , so speak directly to the tv and you do n't need a remote control actually , project manager : but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . industrial designer : but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : and lcd buttons . industrial designer : to push button , yeah , yeah . even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . project manager : turning the tv o on o or off . industrial designer : yeah , turning yeah , yeah . not very complex commands , but easy commands , project manager : adding some vocal commands . industrial designer : expensive buttons yeah , to make some new marketing : yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . </s>
<s> why did the user interface designer propose the concept of intelligent controller ? </s> user interface : attractive . such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . project manager : i 'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . user interface : yeah , it 's very , you know if you 're project manager : yeah . i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? industrial designer : yeah . maybe . user interface : uh i think some time it 's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . project manager : that 's true . yeah , but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . user interface : so you can use your gesture . that 's no problem . marketing : okay . okay . project manager : yeah , but suppose you have a family watching tv , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? user interface : yeah , that 's that 's the advantage of intelligent controller . even you h you have the controller , i can i can say channel three , industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager : yeah , but one other question . marketing : uh if you if if you use the basic user interface : no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . industrial designer : you know when you project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation yeah , industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : no , it 's not so complex . no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . marketing : no , but then it 's it 's like this uh project manager : here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . user interface : yeah . yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . industrial designer : to talk to the to the tv maybe . project manager : you just want to interact with television . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you industrial designer : i if you say one , he switch to channel , project manager : yeah , user interface : no no it 's n y if you lose it industrial designer : so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the tv to switch to channel one . yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah . user interface : would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that industrial designer : we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . but uh i think a user need user interface : yeah , you y that 's a fun that 's not the function of the controller , that 's a function of tv . you can replace your tv with a new tv with internet browsing function , marketing : but you need you need new remote controller then . because if you wan na browse internet or , i do n't know , if you wan na type something , user interface : but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . industrial designer : because the p the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if marketing : cause for example yeah . i mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . marketing : see i mean , that 's the point . user interface : okay . industrial designer : of the remote control . so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . user interface : uh-huh . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : yeah , i think it 's an added value to the remote control and what tha what about the uh materials ?

for example . it 's it 's expensive i i guess . industrial designer : i think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the lcd buttons so . but and it is a kind of other design , i mean . it can also be interesting to have this kind of marketing : but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on . at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use . so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . okay , yeah . marketing : we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . and the other point i have n't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer : spongy 'kay . marketing : okay so this is this maybe does n't really fit with the wooden design . industrial designer : okay , yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : google and project manager : because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . industrial designer : uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . user interface : the smart controller . industrial designer : but and the problem is i i 'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the tv , so speak directly to the tv and you do n't need a remote control actually , project manager : yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . industrial designer : but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : adding some vocal commands . uh you will have to work more , baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons industrial designer : expensive buttons yeah , to make some new project manager : and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . </s>
<s> why did the project manager disapprove of the concept of intelligent controller ? </s> user interface : yeah , it 's very , you know project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . project manager : yeah , but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . marketing : okay . okay . industrial designer : but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control project manager : but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . marketing : oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . project manager : yeah , i think it 's a disadvantage . industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager : yeah . because i suppose we need to do research to have something working . marketing : uh if you if if you use the basic user interface : no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . it 's uh yeah . it 's industrial designer : you know when you project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . because uh the for example for se user interface : no , it 's not so complex . no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . marketing : no , but then it 's it 's like this uh project manager : here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . user interface : yeah . yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . project manager : you just want to interact with television . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command project manager : yeah , user interface : no no it 's n y if you lose it industrial designer : so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the tv to switch to channel one . project manager : okay you so you can build a kind of black box industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . project manager : i think so . which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?

<s> summarize the discussion about product industrial design . </s> project manager : so let 's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . marketing : no y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager : interface ? user interface : attractive . such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . project manager : i 'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . user interface : yeah , it 's very , you know project manager : it 's very big , user interface : if you 're so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . um with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user . okay . no . there this is the three concepts of our controller . project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . user interface : no no we we d we we just are use um no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . yeah , i think it 's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it 's very it 's uh yeah . it 's no it 's uh even for the f um because the the vocabulary the project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . it 's it 's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it 's can recognise chinese . it 's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french . industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe user interface : yeah , because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : no , it 's not so complex . no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . project manager : yeah , but where is the controller ? marketing : no , but then it 's it 's like this uh project manager : here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you project manager : yeah , okay you so you can build a kind of black box marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . project manager : which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? user interface : yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts . so what 's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? there 's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that yeah , you y that 's a fun that 's not the function of the controller , that 's a function of tv . you can replace your tv with a new tv with internet browsing function , but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . project manager : yeah , but uh we want so industrial designer : so , yeah . project manager : yeah , why not ? if it 's marketing : you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . marketing : i mean , that 's the point . project manager : uh i think there 's something wrong with your user interface : it did did n't r receive it . did n't receive it . industrial designer : and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , and the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come user interface : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . industrial designer : and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : and what tha what about the uh materials ? industrial designer : and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager : impersonal , mm-hmm . industrial designer : it 's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , i do n't know high cl so a special high class , project manager : yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer : yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood project manager : mm-hmm . mm . industrial designer : and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager : yeah , we want something easy to use and so i think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : so wood . industrial designer : i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . i think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the lcd buttons so . project manager : i dunno . i think we have only uh five minutes left . marketing : so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting . um user really really want a fancy look and feel . they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on . now i if we look at fashion in general um okay . wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . industrial designer : spongy 'kay . marketing : okay so this is this maybe does n't really fit with the wooden design . industrial designer : yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer : very stuff okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . marketing : device , so um okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . project manager : so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer : yeah . solar . marketing : yeah , so when i think it 's project manager : so you think case . something spongy . someth no wood . industrial designer : and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . user interface : the smart controller . industrial designer : but and the problem is i i 'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the tv , so speak directly to the tv and you do n't need a remote control actually , project manager : yeah , industrial designer : but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : so maybe we 'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , industrial designer : i think the supplement can be the voice . it is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager : with a module ? you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use uh you will have to work more , baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons industrial designer : expensive buttons yeah , to make some new marketing : yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . project manager : and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something . </s>
<s> why did the group decide to use both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation when discussing the industrial design ? </s> user interface : it 's hard f i it 's easy for you to remember it . or to recognise it , yeah . yeah . industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . project manager : yeah , but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . marketing : yeah but this industrial designer : but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control project manager : but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . industrial designer : that 's right . marketing : oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . user interface : yeah , that 's that 's the advantage of intelligent controller . even you h you have the controller , i can i can say channel three , industrial designer : it 's it 's project manager : yeah , i think it 's a disadvantage . user interface : it 's advantage . industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager : how how much will it cost ? industrial designer : no , more expensive maybe . user interface : how much ? marketing : uh if you if if you use the basic project manager : so you think it wo n't cost an not a lot for us ? or ? user interface : it 's uh yeah . it 's no it 's uh even for the f um because the the vocabulary the industrial designer : you know when you project manager : mm-mm . yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . it 's it 's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it 's can recognise chinese . it 's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french . industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : yeah . yeah . no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . project manager : yeah , but where is the controller ? marketing : no , but then it 's it 's like this uh project manager : here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . user interface : yeah . yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you project manager : yeah , user interface : no no it 's n y if you lose it industrial designer : yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . yeah , project manager : which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? industrial designer : it 's not really the we user interface : but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . project manager : you do n't need to tune it . industrial designer : so , yeah . user interface : yeah , if if if if you 're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? project manager : yeah , why not ? if it 's user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . project manager : not too expensive too . user interface : but the there 's there 's n there 's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there 's no key feature in the new controller . project manager : maybe you you record it somewhere else . industrial designer : yeah , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , and the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : yeah , i think it 's an added value to the remote control and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , industrial designer : alrigh in fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it 'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it 's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , i do n't know high cl so a special high class , project manager : yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer : yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah , i think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , project manager : so wood . industrial designer : and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . i think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the lcd buttons so . marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer : very stuff okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . project manager : so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , industrial designer : yeah . solar . marketing : mm-hmm project manager : uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . industrial designer : no wood but plastic ? marketing : maybe not no wood , but i mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . industrial designer : i think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . it depends on the design we want , marketing : yeah , maybe the base . project manager : it 's it 's natural . industrial designer : yeah , it 's natural and it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it 's ecol google and user interface : the smart controller . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : so maybe we 'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . user interface : yeah . it 's good . project manager : yeah , i think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . industrial designer : i think the supplement can be the voice . it is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager : with a module ? you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . </s>
<s> what was the decision of discussion about the material when talking about industrial design ? </s> marketing : no y you do the minutes first , or ? project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . marketing : okay . okay . project manager : yeah , i think it 's a disadvantage . user interface : it 's advantage . industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers , eh . project manager : how how much will it cost ? user interface : how much ? no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . it 's uh yeah . it 's no it 's uh even for the f um because the the vocabulary the project manager : mm-mm . industrial designer : 'cause it it have to be universal , project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . it 's it 's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it 's can recognise chinese . it 's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french . industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : no , it 's not so complex . marketing : we have to take care of the twelve euros user interface : no no no it 's not i think that 's n that 's not a problem because you you do n't have to wear a microphone . it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . project manager : yeah , but where is the controller ? here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . industrial designer : to talk to the to the tv maybe . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command no no it 's n y if you lose it industrial designer : so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the tv to switch to channel one . yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . project manager : which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? user interface : but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . marketing : no . no . project manager : yeah , but uh we want so you do n't need to tune it . industrial designer : so , yeah . marketing : i mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . marketing : i mean , that 's the point . industrial designer : it 's the working design . sorry . component design . so this yeah so this is the described use what ? are you inst user interface : it did did n't r receive it . did n't receive it . industrial designer : i do n't think so . okay , okay . yes . and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , and the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : yeah , i think it 's an added value to the remote control industrial designer : but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , project manager : and what tha what about the uh materials ? yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer : yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . yeah , i think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , project manager : so wood . industrial designer : i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion project manager : no it 's fashion , yeah . industrial designer : and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . marketing : okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . industrial designer : spongy 'kay . marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer : very stuff okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . marketing : device , so um okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : yeah . solar . no wood but plastic ? marketing : yeah , maybe the base . project manager : it 's it 's natural . th the feeling is natural , industrial designer : yeah , it 's natural mm , yeah , it 's not right , so . project manager : but it 's still fashion . user interface : the smart controller . industrial designer : but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : that 's true . so maybe we 'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , and lcd buttons . industrial designer : yeah , lcd . marketing : what interface ? industrial designer : i think the supplement can be the voice . it is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager : with a module ? you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use adding some vocal commands . industrial designer : need it to be , okay . project manager : so you will have to model model something . user interface : okay . yep </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about user requirements . </s> project manager : so let 's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . industrial designer : project manager : technical accessoire ? interface ? user interface : mm . so uh first i will present the concept of user interface . um there 's three concepts in the user interface . so first one it 's a google controller . the second is a fancy controller . the last one is uh intelligent controller . so there are three concepts in our controller . um n next i will explain one by one , the first is google controller . um , so i want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . so it 's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . uh this is a first concept of our controller . the second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um industrial designer : a nice one . user interface : attractive . such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . project manager : i 'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . industrial designer : marketing : user interface : yeah , it 's very , you know project manager : it 's very big , user interface : if you 're project manager : yeah . user interface : so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . um with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user . project manager : okay . something else ? user interface : okay . no . there this is the three concepts of our controller . project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . do you think they will be able to use gestures ? marketing : project manager : or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , i think they will be bored after a while . you do n't think so ? user interface : uh i think some time it 's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . for example , if you can not find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . user interface : so you can use your gesture . that 's no problem . industrial designer : marketing : yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? project manager : broken arm ? user interface : for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to user interface : no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager : yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international marketing : industrial designer : project manager : remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation marketing : yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or user interface : no , it 's not so complex . where is the controller ? industrial designer : marketing : industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : project manager : just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . you think it 's possible ? industrial designer : yeah . we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . but uh i think a user need marketing : cause for example yeah . user interface : but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . marketing : i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , uh thi this i mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition user interface : uh to frahan . with frahan , then you can prepare your slides , industrial designer : i s because i in my presentation i do n't have here with of the remote control . so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside user interface : okay . okay . industrial designer : and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . user interface : uh-huh . industrial designer : and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion project manager : no it 's fashion , yeah . industrial designer : project manager : i dunno . i think we have only uh five minutes left . participant four ? functional requirements ? marketing : uh no , trend watching . the other one . yeah . uh , i think so , just yeah , so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what 's the fashion in general i 've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . project manager : marketing : so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting . um user really really want a fancy look and feel . they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on . at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use . so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . now i if we look at fashion in general um okay . wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , industrial designer : ah yes . yeah , yeah . okay , yeah . marketing : 'cause it 's it 's really what people want . even if it 's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it 's three . then easy to use uh it 's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . industrial designer : and fruit and vegetables yeah . marketing : we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . and the other point i have n't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer : spongy 'kay . okay , yeah , yeah . yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . project manager : yeah , industrial designer : yeah , turning yeah , yeah . not very complex commands , but easy commands , project manager : adding some vocal commands . simple ones ? okay . so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we 'll you will all have to work in in your direction . so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . industrial designer : project manager : uh you will have to work more , baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons industrial designer : expensive buttons yeah , to make some new yeah . marketing : yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . project manager : and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . </s>
<s> what did the marketing recommend to do when discussing the problem of fashion ? </s> industrial designer : marketing : no y you do the minutes first , or ? user interface : yeah , it 's very , you know industrial designer : yeah . yeah . user interface : so the last uh concept is intelligent . we want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . um with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user . project manager : i just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , i think they will be bored after a while . you do n't think so ? industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . user interface : so you can use your gesture . that 's no problem . industrial designer : user interface : for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very marketing : okay . okay . industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to user interface : how much ? no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . it 's uh yeah . it 's project manager : mm-mm . yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international marketing : industrial designer : project manager : remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation mechanism . it 's it 's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it 's can recognise chinese . it 's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french . industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe user interface : yeah , industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . if you have the language , you have to develop for each country . because uh the for example for se user interface : no , it 's not so complex . industrial designer : project manager : here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . yeah , user interface : no no it 's n y if you lose it marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . project manager : okay . user interface : we should have confidence in technology . industrial designer : i think he need a control that is very reliable , yeah . yeah . project manager : just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . you think it 's possible ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . marketing : i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . see industrial designer : ye user interface : industrial designer : yeah , working design , it 's the working design . sorry . component design . so this yeah so this is the described use marketing : user interface : okay . marketing : industrial designer : and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . so and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . and the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common project manager : yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer : and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . project manager : so wood . industrial designer : i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the lcd you know lighted buttons because , you know , it 's i do n't know um yeah , in the dark , it 's fashion project manager : no it 's fashion , yeah . industrial designer : and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . project manager : i dunno . i think we have only uh five minutes left . marketing : so again , it 's pretty much similar to what i 've said in the previous meeting . um user really really want a fancy look and feel . they 're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . like the one you 've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically but it 's it 's not what they want and uh so , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it 's sort of related to what you 've said with the speech recognition and so on . at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use . so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . now i if we look at fashion in general um okay . wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . and the other point i have n't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , industrial designer : spongy 'kay . marketing : yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer : very stuff okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . marketing : okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : yeah . solar . project manager : so you think case . something spongy . someth no wood . industrial designer : no wood but plastic ? project manager : but it 's still fashion . industrial designer : google and uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested and how it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . user interface : the smart controller . project manager : yeah , adding some vocal commands . okay . so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we 'll you will all have to work in in your direction . so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . industrial designer : project manager : uh you will have to work more , baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons industrial designer : expensive buttons yeah , to make some new yeah . project manager : and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , industrial designer : okay . project manager : so you will have to model model something . </s>
<s> what was the decision of the discussion about fulfilling user requirements ? </s> project manager : interface ? yeah , why not . user interface : so the last uh concept is intelligent . we want uh we want our controller to be smart , project manager : okay . something else ?

industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's a good that 's a good point , so . marketing : okay . okay . industrial designer : but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control marketing : oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . project manager : yeah , i think it 's a disadvantage . industrial designer : and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to project manager : yeah , but one other question . industrial designer : manual controllers , eh . project manager : how how much will it cost ? industrial designer : no , more expensive maybe . user interface : how much ? project manager : yeah . because i suppose we need to do research to have something working . user interface : no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we do n't have to do some basic research on this field . project manager : so you think it wo n't cost an not a lot for us ? or ? user interface : it 's uh yeah . it 's project manager : mm-mm . yeah , but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international remote control . we need something that is international . suppose we 're we want to sell it in france . user interface : yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it 's it has some some um adaptation industrial designer : it 's a very smart , it 's a very smart controller maybe project manager : and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? industrial designer : yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . user interface : no , it 's not so complex . project manager : yeah , but where is the controller ? here it 's uh an object . but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . industrial designer : to talk to the to the tv maybe . user interface : yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you you use your command industrial designer : so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the tv to switch to channel one . yeah . yeah . yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . marketing : yeah , i dunno . it 's a bit risky risky . project manager : i think so . which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? industrial designer : i think he need a control that is very reliable , user interface : yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts . so what 's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? there 's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? but it 's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it 's it 's also the issue of the tv . marketing : cause for example yeah . user interface : yeah , but we do we do we we we can not rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , project manager : yeah , but uh we want so yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . industrial designer : so , yeah . marketing : you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . i do n't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . google is is simple , works fine , so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it 's already a lot . user interface : yeah . oh yes , but there 's no big difference between the traditional controller . project manager : not too expensive too . user interface : but the there 's there 's n there 's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there 's no key feature in the new controller . marketing : i mean , that 's the point . project manager : i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um baba 's presentation . industrial designer : of the remote control . so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside and so . so i in fact the the f something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like lcd where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , and the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . project manager : yeah , i think it 's an added value to the remote control industrial designer : ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so hmm . project manager : and what tha what about the uh materials ? yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . industrial designer : yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . yeah . yeah . yeah , yeah . project manager : and you think that we will be industrial designer : yeah , i think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , project manager : so wood . and what about the buttons ? no it 's fashion , yeah . industrial designer : and it 's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch tv in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it 's very easy so , right . project manager : participant four ? functional requirements ? marketing : at the same time , it 's important that it 's easy to use . so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . okay , so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . okay , yeah . marketing : we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . and the other point i have n't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh industrial designer : very stuff okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . marketing : okay , tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . industrial designer : yeah . solar . project manager : pro-ecology consumers . marketing : yeah , maybe the base . project manager : but it 's still fashion . industrial designer : uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they 're interested user interface : the smart controller . industrial designer : but and the problem is i i 'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the tv , so speak directly to the tv and you do n't need a remote control actually , but it will be embedded on the tv and not on the remote control , so . project manager : so maybe we 'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , industrial designer : i think the supplement can be the voice . it is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of project manager : with a module ? you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use adding some vocal commands . and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . industrial designer : need it to be , okay . user interface : okay . yep </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> marketing : we have n't decided on an order . user interface : i dunno , you seem like you know about industrial designer : yeah , uh i d i was an engineer before i came here . project manager : i guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can wha what um well probably our target group and how it 's gon na going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface : yeah . okay . so is our target group then people so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? industrial designer : it 's easy to implement . user interface : okay . so the marketing : yeah , for sure , yeah . project manager : yeah , teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer : well marketing : i mean industrial designer : i 'm not sure how you would implement it . marketing : yeah , i 'm happy with that . completely . user interface : okay so are we gon na have just some kind of a like we 'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . project manager : so you you 'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can marketing : so do you plug it in the t_ you plug it in tv , this thing ? user interface : so it 's now like a two-part thing . so we get to design that too . marketing : do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? project manager : we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it 's user interface : yeah . then it can live anywhere . so i yeah . marketing : um , so need the other buttons . so we have this mm . user interface : that was that was me . project manager : they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . marketing : it not v_h_s_ here ? project manager : but d_v_d_ probably is . industrial designer : yeah , other than that region and coding thing . user interface : um project manager : and and if we 're if we 're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it 's gon na be d_v_d_ type , that 's the the technology these days . marketing : but v_c_r_s yeah . yeah , for sure . user interface : i mean , like because unless you know industrial designer : yeah , i never think to hold something down . user interface : yeah . b yeah . marketing : you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then and then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . user interface : well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like marketing : what do you mean the function ? yeah but it knows for some reason . project manager : so it 's like holding marketing : and then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there 's already ones with up and down here , that i 've seen . i do n't know , user interface : yeah , i dunno , i dunno . you do n't think so ? okay . marketing : yeah yeah yeah . well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . because , the other thing , i did n't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it 's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote user interface : this is just for tv , it 's not for or it is does need to be compatible with project manager : um industrial designer : i a d_v_d_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , project manager : you know actually our our new project requirements , i 'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things . user interface : so how do you switch project manager : so i 'll i 'll check that and update you on the next user interface : so , i know i 'm not c really clear on what project manager : mm . mm . user interface : i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like . so project manager : but i yeah . industrial designer : oh . but i think the circle only does channel is n't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you do n't wan na project manager : um , yeah , let 's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . </s>
<s> what did the group discuss the functional design on the remote control ? </s> marketing : i 'll just put the cable in . project manager : also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let 's be fashionable i guess . um if we have something i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . okay . um . so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . um , yeah . do let 's wha what um well probably our target group and how it 's gon na going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s user interface : yeah . okay . so is our target group then people so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? marketing : the the buzzer you mean , well that 's for speech recognition . industrial designer : i 'm not sure how you would implement it . it 's a cool idea but user interface : okay so are we gon na have just some kind of a like we 'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer : well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place since the tv already has power . yeah you click the button , it 's gon na send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it 's not gon na work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . project manager : so you you 'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can industrial designer : it would have to be sold separately because if the sender 's on the remote then you 'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . marketing : so do you plug it in the t_ you plug it in tv , this thing ? user interface : make it fashionable . um , okay . marketing : mm . are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? um , so need the other buttons . so we have this mm . project manager : so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r i do n't remember who showed them , yeah you you did um , they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface : i think w i think they 're both sort of just like general remo they 're both general remotes . yeah . so . okay , let 's see if i can i think still though , it should n't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . marketing : well for sure we need the um i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power 's just a button , and it 's not used that much , project manager : you know , i 've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it 's it 's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you do n't actually have a separate power button , it 's just user interface : it seems like that would be hard though . yeah . just 'cause i would n't i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . project manager : yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . industrial designer : yeah , i never think to hold something down . project manager : i guess . so we definitely want a power button and numbers . right . marketing : well even um ipod thing , like um , i do n't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of yeah yeah , it 's just and it 's one thing which has everything . user interface : yeah , and it is yeah . it is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? like a disc . yeah . yeah . it 's like it 's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . marketing : and then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . project manager : we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that 's the if that 's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . user interface : yeah . so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to marketing : what do you mean the function ? user interface : i mean like okay , 'cause so i dunno , i guess okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it 'll s like say you 're go you 're going clockwise . that that means you 're gon na go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it 'll go down . so if you wan na switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you 're either in that mode or you 're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that 's that way and volume is up and down . industrial designer : if it works on an ipod then it works . user interface : yeah . so you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . marketing : well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . user interface : okay . that 's what i mean . okay . okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . project manager : so it 's like holding marketing : and then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there 's already ones with up and down here , that i 've seen . for the ipod you press an w right if you 're on the channel let 's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . user interface : i think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod . but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of industrial designer : i do n't think it 's the wheel dealy . user interface : yeah . i 'm thinking we could if if we 're hav so ba i mean but an ipod just has that circle thing you know . industrial designer : and they 're re-programmable are n't they ? user interface : yeah . well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just marketing : yeah yeah yeah . well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . because , the other thing , i did n't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it 's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote um , what other buttons were there ? volume oh we 've ts just said that . user interface : so how do you switch industrial designer : but it 's cool to have it all on one , because you wan na turn it on then you wan na turn up the volume , and then you wan na go to the menu , so you do n't wan na switch . user interface : i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like . so industrial designer : well but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons . user interface : but i mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . industrial designer : but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the tv so you do n't have to switch . </s>
<s> what did the group discuss the finder button and call button ? </s> industrial designer : but sometimes you have to do it it 's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . user interface : yeah . okay . so is our target group then people so do we wan na go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? okay . so the marketing : the the buzzer you mean , project manager : yeah , teenagers and young professionals . industrial designer : well and also , if the tv is on it 's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv 's gon na switch itself to channel one , marketing : i mean industrial designer : i 'm not sure how you would implement it . user interface : okay so are we gon na have just some kind of a like we 'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer : well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place since the tv already has power . yeah you click the button , it 's gon na send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it 's not gon na work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . yeah , it 'd probably just stick it on your tv so if you need to find the remote , click the button . marketing : mm . are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . project manager : we probably leave that . i mean i guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it 's industrial designer : i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it 's in the couch or wherever . marketing : um , so need the other buttons . so we have this mm . mm-hmm . project manager : they 're i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . user interface : i think w i think they 're both sort of just like general remo they 're both general remotes . project manager : oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . and and if we 're if we 're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it 's gon na be d_v_d_ type , that 's the the technology these days . user interface : like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . marketing : well for sure we need the um i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power 's just a button , and it 's not used that much , project manager : you know , i 've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it 's it 's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you do n't actually have a separate power button , it 's just industrial designer : yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . marketing : you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then it 's like l this like that , and then you do that . and then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . yeah , click o actually click on to have project manager : we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that 's the if that 's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . user interface : well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like i mean like okay , 'cause so i dunno , i guess okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it 'll s like say you 're go you 're going clockwise . that that means you 're gon na go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it 'll go down . marketing : well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . user interface : okay . that 's what i mean . okay . okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . project manager : so it 's like holding marketing : and then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there 's already ones with up and down here , that i 've seen . project manager : you can o and you you is there an extra actual button ? or are you actually you 're just using the mouse to go up and down . like user interface : it 's like a b marketing : for the ipod you press an w right if you 're on the channel let 's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . right . mm-hmm . like you could just have oh , like marketing : you could click and then have it up and down , user interface : like project manager : is that what makes them expensi i think it 's all of marketing : i think it industrial designer : you can put on your songs and then put on a different set , marketing : channel selection . project manager : um industrial designer : i a d_v_d_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , user interface : so how do you switch project manager : so i 'll i 'll check that and update you on the next but we 'll hold off on that 'cause marketing : but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote . industrial designer : but it 's cool to have it all on one , because you wan na turn it on then you wan na turn up the volume , and then you wan na go to the menu , so you do n't wan na switch . user interface : so you 'd have to have like i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like . so industrial designer : well but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons . oh . but i think the circle only does channel is n't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you do n't wan na </s>
<s> what did group members think of the speech recognition design suggested by marketing ? </s> marketing : um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . they 're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . and um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . the other ones are the settings , and they 're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , i do n't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example would n't actually pay for this sort of thing . um i do n't i do n't know um what the decision to be made is , but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . and that 's all i have to say about the matter , um . project manager : wha what um well probably our target group and how it 's gon na going to appeal to our target group and i dunno the the s marketing : yeah , for sure , yeah . well that 's for speech recognition . and screen . that 's only for speech recognition and screen . industrial designer : and also , if the tv is on it 's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv 's gon na switch itself to channel one , it 's a cool idea but project manager : if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . marketing : yeah , i 'm happy with that . user interface : okay so are we gon na have just some kind of a like we 'll have the buzzer on the som like on the tv itself . industrial designer : well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place since the tv already has power . project manager : so do you think even though we 're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . yeah . user interface : so i yeah . project manager : and and if we 're if we 're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it 's gon na be d_v_d_ type , that 's the the technology these days . user interface : like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . marketing : oh okay , yeah . user interface : i mean , like because unless you know project manager : it might be confusing . yeah . yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . user interface : yeah . marketing : well even um ipod thing , like um , i do n't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of user interface : that sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . marketing : yeah . because people li seem now the ipod 's out people seem to like this thing that there 's no know you do n't have one two three four five user interface : yeah , yeah . i think that 's an interesting idea , 'cause it 's cool , it 's it 's funny like you f like i just i do n't have an ipod but like i , you know , i just like started messing around with one of my friend 's the other day , and you just sort of and it 's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it 's not that hard , you know . project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah , it 's just and it 's one thing which has everything . well ca n't it tell the like ca n't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then it 's like l this like that , and then you do that . project manager : we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that 's the if that 's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . marketing : yeah . user interface : well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like marketing : yeah . yeah . user interface : so if you wan na switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you 're either in that mode or you 're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that 's that way and volume is up and down . marketing : yeah but it knows for some reason . industrial designer : if it works on an ipod then it works . project manager : so it 's like holding marketing : and then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there 's already ones with up and down here , that i 've seen . project manager : like you could just have user interface : i think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod . industrial designer : you can put on your songs and then put on a different set , project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah yeah yeah . well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . because , the other thing , i did n't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it 's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that 's another thing they complained about . user interface : yeah . marketing : but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote . industrial designer : but it 's cool to have it all on one , because you wan na turn it on then you wan na turn up the volume , and then you wan na go to the menu , so you do n't wan na switch . user interface : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : so you 'd have to have like i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like . so industrial designer : well but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons . project manager : but i yeah . industrial designer : oh . but i think the circle only does channel is n't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you do n't wan na user interface : yeah but it it would be industrial designer : but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the tv so you do n't have to switch . user interface : so but i 'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you 're if you 're on tv , like you can switch channels , but then if uh

<s> summarize the discussion about the vcr / vhr / dvd capability button . </s> marketing : the the buzzer you mean , industrial designer : well and also , if the tv is on it 's making sound and the people on the tv are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the tv 's gon na switch itself to channel one , i 'm not sure how you would implement it . it 's a cool idea but user interface : hu yeah . industrial designer : well you would have to have a button on a tv or on your wall or some place since the tv already has power . yeah you click the button , it 's gon na send out a signal , and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the tv it 's not gon na work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . user interface : okay . okay . project manager : so you you 'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can industrial designer : it would have to be sold separately because if the sender 's on the remote then you 'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . project manager : right . yeah , yeah . marketing : okay . okay . industrial designer : i think that 's what the phone has , user interface : i think w i think they 're both sort of just like general remo they 're both general remotes . project manager : oh really . 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . user interface : and uh industrial designer : does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across international ? user interface : um like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the tv . marketing : well for sure we need the um i think we can just design the channels ? i mean power 's just a button , and it 's not used that much , project manager : you know , i 've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it 's it 's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . so you do n't actually have a separate power button , it 's just marketing : oh okay , yeah . project manager : yeah . besides you like to be able to go power . marketing : well even um ipod thing , like um , i do n't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of user interface : yeah , yeah . i think that 's an interesting idea , 'cause it 's cool , yeah . okay . marketing : you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then it 's like l this like that , and then you do that . project manager : okay . okay . marketing : and then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . project manager : we could we could even have four buttons , like , if that 's the if that 's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . user interface : well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like marketing : what do you mean the function ? user interface : i mean like okay , 'cause so i dunno , i guess okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it 'll s like say you 're go you 're going clockwise . that that means you 're gon na go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it 'll go down . so if you wan na switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you 're either in that mode or you 're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that 's that way and volume is up and down . industrial designer : if it works on an ipod then it works . marketing : well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . user interface : okay . that 's what i mean . okay . okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . project manager : so it 's like holding marketing : and then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there 's already ones with up and down here , that i 've seen . user interface : it 's like a b marketing : for the ipod you press an w right if you 're on the channel let 's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . project manager : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . right . mm-hmm . like you could just have oh , like user interface : but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of project manager : is that what makes them expensi i think it 's all of they have so much memory though , that 's it 's industrial designer : and they 're re-programmable are n't they ? marketing : and that 's another thing they complained about . um , what other buttons were there ? volume oh we 've ts just said that . project manager : um industrial designer : and menu maybe . oh yeah . project manager : but s yeah uh . marketing : but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote . user interface : so you 'd have to have like i think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you 're either on tv , you 're on d_v_d_ or you 're on v_c_r_ , or you 're like . so industrial designer : oh . but i think the circle only does channel is n't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you do n't wan na user interface : yeah but it it would be so but i 'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you 're if you 're on tv , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you 're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different i mean do we need to think about that , </s>
<s> summarize the meeting </s> grad a : mm - hmm . good . i know that he 's going to like , taiwan and other places to eat . so . so that 's why keith and i are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting . grad f : huh . yeah , i 'm just gon na sit here and yeah , it 's a great story . professor e : well , i think you 're supposed to ok . we can do this . grad a : and any rate ? grad f : well , could we ? grad c : we could . we might . professor e : well , you you had s you said there were two things that you might wan na do . one was rehearse your i i talk grad c : in our beloved tourism domain . but , with a focus on grad d : er , actually , my only copy , now that i think about it , but . i already read half of it , so it 's ok . professor e : yeah , no i s i s i see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that . grad d : ok . cuz i read halfway but i did n't see a castle thing . grad c : current formalism thing that you presented . grad a : ok . i will . ok . ok . ok . grad c : that 's when i 'm meeting with wolfgang wahlster to sell him this idea . ok ? then i 'm also going to present a little talk at eml , about what we have done here and so of course , i 'm i 'm gon na start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then i 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning the cave forty - five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time . and so grad f : the system breaking . professor e : and , you know , the yeah , yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . so that 's one thing . um . depends . i mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , ok ? grad c : um . and , of course , you know , the the big picture is this bit . professor e : ok , so , so anyway , i i agree that 's not central . grad c : yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the x - schema slide , uh , i yeah , but i also have stuff you trash you left over , well , i i do n't feel bad about it at all grad a : i 'm glad to see propagation . grad c : hmm ? propagated ? i mean i might even mention that this work you 're doing is sort of also with the mpi in leipzig , so . because , um , eml is building up a huge thing in leipzig . professor e : yeah , it 's different , this is the , uh , dna building , or someth the double helix building . grad d : wait , they 're building a building in the shape of dna , grad a : what ? what ? of what grad d : y you definitely wan na w do n't wan na waste that money on research , grad a : the building ? professor e : right . well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money . see you th you th you then fill it with researchers . grad a : and give them more money . they just want a fun place for them to to work . grad c : well , the the offices are actually a little the , think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes , and the offices are in in the glass half - dome . grad f : alright , let 's stop talking about this . grad a : they are w now building it ? grad c : uh , as a model . professor e : so , yeah , i think that 's that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the this is interacting with , uh , people in italy but also definitely the people in leipzig and the the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . ok . ok . anyway ! enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal . grad a : in the presentation ? grad c : oh , in the presentation here . professor e : well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place oh , did you put in something about , grad a : that 's not about that , is it ? professor e : right . so 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands does n't , um , i do n't think , say that as clearly as it could . grad c : but `` walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , `` and `` walked into the cafe and broke his nose , `` that 's sort of professor e : oh , it does n't mean that they 're unambiguous . or as some physical object . so there are multiple construals . and in fact that 's part of what has to be done . this is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal . grad d : you con you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so i thought , `` why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? `` uh , oh , uh grad c : yeah , but , y y if you find `` walked smacked into the cafe `` or `` slammed into the wall `` professor e : well , or `` into the cafe `` for that m grad c : yeah . or you can run into an old friend , or run . professor e : but like , `` run into an old friend `` , it probably needs its own construction . i mean , uh , you know , george would have i 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else grad a : all contact . i mean , there there 's contact that does n't social contact , whatever . i mean . grad f : but of course , no , i i i mean it has a life of its own . it 's sort of partially inspired by the spatial grad a : too bad . what ? oh , no no no no no no no no no , we 're not going there . professor e : anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal , you got we could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it . grad a : uh wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , i do n't know , the related work stuff , professor e : ok , f let 's let 's suppose you use `` in `` and `` on `` . i mean , that 's what you started with . grad c : i had two hours w with george on this , so it , professor e : ok , what did he say . grad c : um , uh , he 's that 's , uh , what did i call it here , the transportation schema , something , where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , professor e : right . so so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do . i mean you could do something much simpler like `` under the bus , `` or something , where well , unless he was repairing it or something , grad a : i see . grad c : we had we had initially we 'd started discussing the `` out of film . `` and there 's a lot of `` out of `` analysis , so , um , grad a : yeah , it 's a little it 's , uh we 've thought about it before , uh t uh to use the examples in other papers , and it 's it 's a little complicated . cuz you 're like , it 's a state of there 's resource , the state you know . you 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . grad f : yeah , i mean , but and plus the fact that there 's also s i mean , can you say , like , `` the film ran out `` you know , or , maybe you could say something like `` the film is out `` grad a : yeah , is film the trajector ? professor e : i mean b but the difference grad a : that part is fine . there was ? who ? professor e : well , there i thought or there was a paper on it . or something . grad f : right ? the the `` the syrup spread out `` ? grad a : ok . but more emphasis on the computational ? or emphasis on the linguist ? grad c : computer it 's more there 's going to be the just four computational linguists , by coincidence , but the rest is , whatever , biocomputing people and physicists . professor e : no no no , but not for your talk . i 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes grad c : oh , the thesis ! grad a : oh , i meant this , oh , oh yeah . yeah , we 've thought about that . right . right . professor e : well th well , that 's one . you want to buy something . but the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , um , pfff you know , you wonder how people here make their living , and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery there 's all sorts of stuff going on . right . it 's not for sale . uh . so grad f : well , shoot , is n't that i mean , that 's what figuring that out is what this is about . grad a : yeah , yeah , no , i i agree . grad c : and you can refer back to it , and so you can castles have as tourist sites , have admission fees , so you can say `` where is the castle , how much does it cost ? `` um . `` how far is it from here ? `` grad a : what ? professor e : yeah . essentially , yeah . you know , `` where could i learn its opening hours , `` or something . so we 're thinking about , um , or we could also think about , uh grad c : well i when , uh just f u the data that i 've looked at so far that rec so , you know , mak re making reference to buildings as institutions , as containers , as build professor e : right . as an institution , grad c : yeah , well no , but this that 's what i have , you know , started doing . grad a : `` i wan na go see the van gogh . `` grad c : we , uh i with a i looked with a student i looked at the entire database that we have on heidelberg for cases of metonymy . hardly anything . so not even in descriptions w did we find anything , um , relevant . but ok this is just something we 'll we 'll see , um , professor e : right . s see you . ok , well . i guess if anybody has additional suggestions , grad c : so , if we 're not talk about the lexic so , i mean yeah , maybe we can include that also in our second , uh , data run . we c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . </s>

<s> what was said about eml talk ? </s> grad a : yeah . it 's a ritual . grad c : um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d grad a : anyway . and y uh , email any time , but most usefully before grad d : the twenty - first i 'm assuming . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . grad c : ok ? then i 'm also going to present a little talk at eml , about what we have done here and so of course , i 'm i 'm gon na start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then i 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning the cave forty - five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time . and so they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . and so forth . so basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine nine pm in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . um , and so forth and so forth . that 's sort of motivating it . then what have we done so far ? we had our little bit of , um , um , smartkom stuff , that we did , um , everth that 's the not the construction parser . that 's the , uh , tablet - based parser , twelve ? ok . and , um , and fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . that 's all about that . then i 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about uh , actually i have an example , probably . two s can you hear that ? or should i turn the l volume on . grad a : what is the s ? oh ! grad c : ok . and so forth and so forth . um , i will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , i 'm not gon na put in the figures from liz , but i thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit as much as i can about the ntl story . i i wa i do wan na , um i 'm not quite sure about this , whether i should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , i 'll talk about monkeys in italy . and , um , srini was gon na send me some slides but he did n't do it , so from but i have the paper , i can make a resume of that , and then i stole an x - schema from one of your talks i think . grad a : oh . i was like , `` where 'd you get that ? `` ok . professor e : whatever . grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : end of story . anything i forgot that we should mention ? oh , maybe the fmri stuff . should i mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? professor e : you certainly can . i mean i y i you know , i do n't know grad a : you might just wan na like , tack that on , as a comment , to something . professor e : right , um . well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking grad c : yeah . professor e : and , you know , the yeah , yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . so that 's one thing . um . depends . i mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , ok ? grad c : yeah . professor e : yeah . grad c : um . and , of course , you know , the the big picture is this bit . professor e : right . grad c : but , you know , it would but i do n't think i i am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . i mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people how what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works , grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : yeah , th that that 's c that comes up to the x - schema slide , grad a : ok , right . grad c : uh , i yeah , but i also have stuff you trash you left over , grad a : yeah . grad c : well , i i do n't feel bad about it at all grad a : and give them more money . they just want a fun place for them to to work . professor e : right . right . so , yeah , i think that 's that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the this is interacting with , uh , people in italy but also definitely the people in leipzig and the the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . ok . ok . anyway ! enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal . grad c : yeah , if somebody has something to say . grad a : yeah , that 's what he was talking about . professor e : so i did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor did n't get in yet . well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place oh , did you put in something about , grad c : mm - hmm . um , but i i did not focus on that aspect but , um ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . so it 's the last paragraph before two . so on page two , um , the main focus professor e : uh , ok . yeah . no , it it it s says it but it does n't say it does n't it d it d yeah , it does n't give the punch line . grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : cuz let me tell the gang what i think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , nancy and keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . and the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work . grad f : mm - hmm . professor e : and , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions . grad f : mm - hmm . yeah . professor e : and it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists . grad f : yeah . professor e : mm - hmm . so that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff { comment } you can do the same grammar . and it is the same grammar . but , um , the trick is that the the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . well , `` trouble `` is n't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container . grad d : right . professor e : et cetera . so that 's that 's where this , um , grad d : so with construal you do n't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule . professor e : right . so 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands does n't , um , i do n't think , say that as clearly as it could . grad c : but `` walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , `` and `` walked into the cafe and broke his nose , `` that 's sort of professor e : oh , it does n't mean that they 're unambiguous . grad c : mmm . yeah . mm - hmm . yep . professor e : but it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . grad d : you con you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so i thought , `` why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ? `` uh , oh , uh grad c : yeah , but , y y if you find `` walked smacked into the cafe `` or `` slammed into the wall `` professor e : but like , `` run into an old friend `` , it probably needs its own construction . i mean , uh , you know , george would have i 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad f : yeah . yeah . right . grad a : uh wh when you say all this , do you mean , like , i do n't know , the related work stuff , grad c : and y it 's , you know , we have some constructions and then it 's construed as something , and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that 's also relevant to the to the domain . professor e : ok , f let 's let 's suppose you use `` in `` and `` on `` . i mean , that 's what you started with . grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : so `` in the bus `` and `` on the bus , `` um , that 's actually a little tricky in english because to some extent they 're synonyms . ok . grad c : i had two hours w with george on this , so it , where you can be on the first flight , on the second flight , professor e : right . so so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do . i mean you could do something much simpler like `` under the bus , `` or something , where grad f : yeah . grad a : the state you know . you 're out of the state of having film , right ? and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource . grad f : it 's yeah , i mean , but and plus the fact that there 's also s i mean , can you say , like , `` the film ran out `` you know , or , maybe you could say something like `` the film is out `` grad a : it 's weird . that or , `` having `` is also , um , associated with location , grad c : is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it . professor e : no no no , but not for your talk . i 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes r exactly . it 's because do you wan na c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that that i for example , if y well th well , that 's one . you want to buy something . but the other is , uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood , or , grad f : mm - hmm . professor e : so let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal . so let 's first do a so the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the though , the one you have is n't quite grad a : you mean the s you mean `` the steak wants to pay `` ? like , `` it `` does n't refer to `` thing , `` it refers to acti you know , j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist you could think of it that way , but . grad f : mm - hmm . grad a : hmm . mm - hmm . professor e : ok . can we think of a nice metaphorical use of `` where `` in the tourist 's domain ? um . so you know it 's you you can sometimes use `` where `` f for `` when `` grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : yeah . essentially , yeah . but anyway th so there are there are cases like that . um , yeah . there certainly is that , yeah . you know , `` where could i learn its opening hours , `` or something . alright . yeah . grad c : we c we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth . grad d : for some reason when you said `` feedback electronically `` i thought of that you ever see the simpsons where they 're like the family 's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they do n't like what the other one is saying ? </s>
<s> what was said about the talk and neurons ? </s> professor e : well , you you had s you said there were two things that you might wan na do . one was rehearse your i i talk grad c : because um , if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from yees asking you to send me the , uh , up - to - d grad a : anyway . and y uh , email any time , but most usefully before grad d : the twenty - first i 'm assuming . grad c : twenty - ninth . grad f : that 's grad c : the twenty - ninth . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . grad c : ok ? then i 'm also going to present a little talk at eml , about what we have done here and so of course , i 'm i 'm gon na start out with this slide , so the most relevant aspects of our stay here , and um , then i 'm asking them to imagine that they 're standing somewhere in heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning the cave forty - five is a is a well - known discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time . and so they 're supposed to imagine that , you know , do they think the person wants to go there , or just know where it is ? uh , which is probably not , uh , the case in that discotheque example , or in the bavaria example , you just want to know where it is . and so forth . so basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it 's nine nine pm in the evening then the discotheque question would be , for example , one that might ask for directions instead of just location . um , and so forth and so forth . that 's sort of motivating it . then what have we done so far ? we had our little bit of , um , um , smartkom stuff , that we did , um , everth grad f : oh , you 've got the parser done . sorry . grad c : you have to change those strategies , twelve ? ok . and , um , and fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak . that 's all about that . then i 'm going to talk about the data , you know these things about uh , actually i have an example , probably . two s can you hear that ? or should i turn the l volume on . grad a : what is the s ? oh ! grad c : ok . and so forth and so forth . um , i will talk about our problems with the rephrasing , and how we solved it , and some preliminary observations , also , um , i 'm not gon na put in the figures from liz , but i thought it would interesting to , uh , um , point out that it 's basically the same . um , as in every human - human telephone conversation , and the human - computer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from , uh , some first , uh , observations . then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz , uh how to get there , what actually is happening there today , and then maybe talk about the big picture here , e tell a little bit as much as i can about the ntl story . i i wa i do wan na , um i 'm not quite sure about this , whether i should put this in , um , that , you know , you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works , and then , talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude , i 'll talk about monkeys in italy . and , um , srini was gon na send me some slides but he did n't do it , so from but i have the paper , i can make a resume of that , and then i stole an x - schema from one of your talks i think . grad a : oh . i was like , `` where 'd you get that ? `` ok . grad f : yeah , that looks familiar . grad a : `` looks familiar . `` professor e : whatever . grad c : um , and that 's now i 'm not going to bring that . so that 's basically what i have , so far , and the rest is for airplanes . so x - schemas , then , i would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our bayes - net . grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : end of story . anything i forgot that we should mention ? oh , maybe the fmri stuff . should i mention the fact that , um , we 're also actually started going to start to look at people 's brains in a more direct way ? professor e : you certainly can . i mean i y i you know , i do n't know grad a : you might just wan na like , tack that on , as a comment , to something . professor e : right , um . grad c : `` future activities `` something . professor e : well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons , then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking grad c : yeah . professor e : and , you know , the yeah , yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this , so that grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : and that we 're planning to do this , um , which , we are . so that 's one thing . um . depends . i mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story , ok ? grad c : yeah . professor e : yeah . grad c : um . and , of course , you know , the the big picture is this bit . but , you know , it would but i do n't think i i am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter . i mean , there is interesting stuff in her terms of how language works , so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know , it would be nice to tell people how what 's happening there , plus how the , uh , language learning stuff works , grad a : mm - hmm . grad c : uh , i yeah , but i also have stuff you trash you left over , grad a : yeah . grad c : well , i i do n't feel bad about it at all grad a : and give them more money . they just want a fun place for them to to work . professor e : so , yeah , i think that 's that 's a good point , th th that the date , the , uh , a lot of the this is interacting with , uh , people in italy but also definitely the people in leipzig and the the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys , yeah . ok . ok . anyway ! enough of that , let 's talk about your thesis proposal . grad c : yeah , if somebody has something to say . grad f : you might want to , uh , double - check the spellings of the authors ' names on your references , you had a few , uh , misspells in your slides , there . like i believe you had `` jackendorf `` . yeah . but that 's the only thing i noticed in there . grad a : i 'll probably i c might have i 'll probably have comments for you separately , not important . anyway . grad c : oh , in the presentation here . grad a : yeah , that 's what he was talking about . professor e : so i did note i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor did n't get in yet . well , s reference is one thing , the question is is there any place oh , did you put in something about , grad c : mm - hmm . um , but i i did not focus on that aspect but , um ehhh , um , it 's just underneath , uh , um , that reference to metaphor . so it 's the last paragraph before two . so on page two , um , the main focus professor e : no , it it it s says it but it does n't say it does n't it d it d yeah , it does n't give the punch line . grad c : mm - hmm . professor e : cuz let me tell the gang what i think the punch line is , because it 's actually important , which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , nancy and keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general but cover only base cases . and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal . and the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality , that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work . grad f : mm - hmm . professor e : and , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions . grad f : mm - hmm . yeah . professor e : and it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists . grad f : yeah . professor e : mm - hmm . so that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff { comment } you can do the same grammar . and it is the same grammar . but , um , the trick is that the the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container . well , `` trouble `` is n't a container , but it gets constr construed as a c container . grad d : right . professor e : et cetera . so that 's that 's where this , um , right . so 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework , and the thesis proposal as it stands does n't , um , i do n't think , say that as clearly as it could . grad c : but `` walked into the cafe and ordered a drink , `` and `` walked into the cafe and broke his nose , `` that 's sort of professor e : oh , it does n't mean that they 're unambiguous . grad c : mm - hmm . yep . professor e : but it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle . grad d : you con you conditioned me with your first sentence , and so i thought , `` why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> marketing : check check check check . industrial designer : i received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . so i 'll discuss them with you . user interface : yeah , i received an email as well . project manager : so we 're going to talk about the conceptual model . user interface : the minutes . marketing : but um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and i think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . user interface : well , i 'll i 'll get back on it . marketing : so i took uh that part of the webpage . and it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . this trends i th uh trend i think it 's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . but it 's about uh clothes and shoes . industrial designer : so rubber , kind of . yeah , somewhat like project manager : is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? marketing : just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh yeah , i dun dunno . we have to discuss about that . uh y yeah . main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . yeah , how do we do that ? maybe speech ? we ma must have some kind of gadget . user interface : yeah , i 'll get back on that . i got f also an email from the the technology department . marketing : so maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . user interface : they have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . so they recommended using it . industrial designer : yeah , well actually we have do n't have an idea how much it 's gon na cost . but maybe it 's cheap and it 's easy to implement . user interface : th that 's the only problem . i d they do n't say how much it will cost , so um but uh marketing : oh . it 's mass production . so you can say , you can yeah . but how uh we we 're gon na make many of those . so we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be . user interface : yeah , so uh we got ta de we have to decide on that . l_d_c_ does n't require project manager : yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . yeah , maybe the teletext tel user interface : so the focus is on these two parts . this is how it is now . um here uh well we have volume . for volume ? well then we can even simplify it more . mm maybe . i dunno , but yeah we 'll but uh the position of course can be different . it 's s we have to look uh what 's easy to use , and how it 's easier to use . so we can uh switch these to so that 's something we have to decide on . industrial designer : yeah , we have to keep it simple . project manager : we have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gon na look . user interface : yeah . what we 're gon na do . okay . mm yeah , it 's project manager : so we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer : yeah , mm n not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . user interface : uh ca n't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? can we do that ? so yeah . but with all with logo on it . industrial designer : maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . we decided that , huh ? yeah , we could do that . user interface : yeah , uh or just uh sell different ones . a more yeah , just uh marketing : yeah . the the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , i think is part of the remote control itself . industrial designer : yeah , it 's it 's all on one level . yeah , on one level . marketing : it is in uh the c a remote control uh industrial designer : yeah , i know what you mean . so we have to keep it on the one level . like th the top it 's user interface : i dunno what uh kind of material it is . industrial designer : and um then the l_e_d_ . user interface : or it runs the whole yeah , it can . well , we do n't put put in any fancier technology yet . so industrial designer : then uh some more technical things . project manager : yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so industrial designer : so i guess we j we just need that . i do n't know what they do or nah , but they just said we need it . yeah , but it i we do n't wan na have a ar an how do you call it ? accu . yeah , i think . um these kinda materials can be used . project manager : but it does n't really matter , we just make it plastic . i do n't think that 's an opportunity . just skip it . because we do n't have time for that to to put it in . industrial designer : and um yeah , that was it i guess . we have n't decided yet . marketing : uh but we have to do something about the trend . user interface : yeah , okay . that uh fruit and veg , or marketing : and uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . user interface : yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . titanium . it 's mentioned here uh . project manager : so we have to decide which one we 're going to choose from these . what exactly . because we have to know it . so the energy uh is the recharger . user interface : regular . project manager : yeah , re yeah , regular . yeah , okay . yeah , regular . that 's pretty much it . so uh i 'm not sure . but we do i do n't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . but industrial designer : mm . or should we do it in the next meeting ? user interface : uh i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . project manager : uh that i think that 's the next next meeting . industrial designer : or should we do it in the next meeting ? okay . project manager : okay , so we have this at the moment . user interface : that 's a little problem , of course , as well . industrial designer : i think it 's probably better . user interface : yeah , i agree as well . yeah , i think uh zapping is the highest priority . project manager : yeah ? is this a opportunity , user interface : and then you use those uh industrial designer : uh but i think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so because then it 's it 's easy to know m if i push the the the up so so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . user interface : i think it 's s so simple project manager : okay , so hmm . what did what else we have to discuss about ? i dunno . marketing : yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . project manager : and the led . user interface : no , you have uh it is marketing : and a bit uh user interface : where you can put a ve uh we have if we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . marketing : uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? uh five or something ? and um uh uh buy the product . you buy , you get one . and uh basic . user interface : i think yeah . that 's your choice , i think huh . project manager : so you could put it like that , industrial designer : yeah , so top down . user interface : but th yeah , that can be very simple . least . mm . mm . yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . mm yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . i 've uh i had a lot of picture of old ones . and all curves have already been done . marketing : yeah . what do we do wrong ? hmm . just just more like this and not uh a square . industrial designer : yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . i would do it user interface : yeah . i know we can do a lot more , but project manager : so we have to make a decision , what kind of form it 's gon na have t going to have . industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : does n't have to be . industrial designer : yeah , though that 's a trend . if we want to make it . but yeah , i 'm not a trendwatcher , you are . so marketing : uh the t the trend is it 's not not a lot of trends i uh i found uh project manager : okay , so we have s still one minute left . so just marketing : it the th th yeah , they 're all the same . user interface : yeah okay . so that 's already a very big change industrial designer : yeah , we could do that . project manager : we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . industrial designer : and we we have to build in a microphone and yeah , and i do i do n't know anything about that . marketing : uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said . we have to be original and uh technological innovative . becau user interface : so we can put all the project manager : but it does n't say anything about it , it does n't has to say anything . just you have to just talk to okay , we have to stop it now . so just industrial designer : yeah , i do n't know anything about this , </s>
<s> summarize the presentation on the market trend . </s> industrial designer : i received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . so i 'll discuss them with you . user interface : yeah , i received an email as well . which one was mine ? project manager : so that 's me . industrial designer : mm no . marketing : uh project manager : okay , we just talked about it looks . has to look nice . usability is very important . people do n't want to spend money on something that 's similar to cheaper ones . um it has to be very basic , not too many buttons . light switches on if you use a button . uh text tv still has to be a possibility . and it has to be easy to learn . that were the things i uh make minutes of . and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text tv button . that are the functions . that right ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . so i just want to give you uh mike again , the first uh presentation of your marketing : shall i start ? project manager : yeah . marketing : no . okay well i received an email okay . i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it . uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . so it 's very important for us to create something new . so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . uh this uh aspect is the most important one . uh it came out of the research . it uh is twice important as the following . the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition . but um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and i think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . project manager : but we already have the flashing flashing light on the marketing : uh maybe maybe something new . we have to discuss about it s uh okay , uh user interface : well , i 'll i 'll get back on it . marketing : features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . and that 's very hard i think . uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . but uh that was an overall uh point . we already discussed that . um i 've got one picture . uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . so i took uh that part of the webpage . and it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . this trends i th uh trend i think it 's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . but it 's about uh clothes and shoes . but the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . user interface : spongy . marketing : but spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer : spongy . marketing : spongy . okay . yeah . yeah , it 's something that uh it stand there . but i did n't knew uh knew what it means . so spongy means y yeah . user interface : how are you gon na make it ? marketing : what do i think ? uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , i think about changeable fronts . just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh yeah , i dun dunno . we have to discuss about that . uh y yeah . main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . yeah , how do we do that ? maybe speech ? we ma must have some kind of gadget . user interface : yeah , i 'll get back on that . i got f also an email from the the technology department . th that 's the only problem . i d they do n't say how much it will cost , so um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition , i think it would be better to implement lcd as well . marketing : oh . it 's mass production . so you can say , you can project manager : yeah , but a telephone okay , yeah . but a telephone also have a lcd and and it 's about t two hundred euros . marketing : yeah . okay . that was this ? user interface : l_d_c_ does n't require industrial designer : it 's m the most expensive . yeah , it says in the email . the display requires an advanced chip . user interface : okay . and speech recognition ? advanced . yeah . industrial designer : i i have n't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface : yeah okay . so we well we can i had uh to make a sort of a design . so i did some searching on the internet . i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players . mobile phones . uh i do n't think it 's fits in the the modern theme as well . so well . yeah , well it 's basically it 's it 's here . project manager : yeah , that 's better . user interface : they 're on top ? you mean uh these to the low ? mm maybe . i dunno , but yeah we 'll those two , yeah . well that 's that 's my findings . so uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . m_p_ three player . and uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we i do n't think we should put it on top then . i think that , if we 're gon na put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's cool . user interface : so if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . which wo n't look good on the front side i think . project manager : okay . user interface : so that 's something we have to decide on . industrial designer : yeah , we have to keep it simple . project manager : we have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gon na look . user interface : yeah . what we 're gon na do . okay . industrial designer : okay , the component design . i looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . so uh this was on the web site . if you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . so flashy kinda colours . uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . not nothing square-like . project manager : okay , so hmm , okay . so we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer : yeah , mm n not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . no , okay . that 's a that 's a sen that 's just a matter of tastes , but project manager : yeah , we make it som maybe we have to make it from soft material . uh i 'm not sure . industrial designer : maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . we decided that , huh ? yeah , it 's it 's all on one level . yeah , on one level . yeah , i know what you mean . so we have to keep it on the one level . like th the top it 's project manager : is it okay . okay , cool . just make it some different colours . blue , red and green , or something . user interface : well , we do n't put put in any fancier technology yet . so project manager : yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so is that still the industrial designer : yeah , but it i we do n't wan na have a ar an how do you call it ? accu . project manager : it 's dark in the room . no . industrial designer : yeah , i think . um these kinda materials can be used . and um yeah , that was it i guess . marketing : uh but we have to do something about the trend . the trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . user interface : yeah , okay . that uh fruit and veg , or titanium . it 's mentioned here uh . industrial designer : titanium , uh i think it 's too expensive . project manager : so we have to decide which one we 're going to choose from these . what exactly . because we have to know it . so the energy uh is the recharger . yeah , re yeah , regular . yeah , okay . yeah , regular . that 's pretty much it . user interface : uh i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . project manager : yeah . that 's for the next one . but you definitely get a specific instruction . user interface : okay , so now we 're ka thirty minutes alone again ? project manager : but th think about something that 's more rounded . just and more it has to be user interface : just a bit cur okay , i 'll see if i can see any of those . industrial designer : what ? project manager : if i draw here it draws about four centimetres lower than we 'd have this . is that okay ? user interface : uh wh what is the middle part ? yeah , i think uh zapping is the highest priority . project manager : yeah ? is this a opportunity , but still the next it 's still the next one . does n't make user interface : think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? project manager : uh yeah . marketing : uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? uh five or something ? project manager : yeah , five . let 's give five . marketing : and um uh uh buy the product . you buy , you get one . and uh basic . user interface : i think yeah . that 's your choice , i think huh . marketing : but that 's a round one . maybe we can choose then . user interface : yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . mm yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . i 've uh i had a lot of picture of old ones . and all curves have already been done . marketing : uh it 's very annoying . okay . user interface : so uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . and uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . project manager : okay . yeah , it 's cool . industrial designer : yeah , though that 's a trend . if we want to make it . but yeah , i 'm not a trendwatcher , you are . so marketing : uh the t the trend is spongy and fruity . user interface : yeah . no . spongy marketing : it 's not not a lot of trends i uh i found uh project manager : okay , so we have s still one minute left . so just but i i think it 's still for older people . you j still have older people . it 's only annoying if it if it 's like that f formed like that , like f whatever . just you have a normal industrial designer : yeah , but we 're we 're aiming at a young public . marketing : yeah , they 're all the same . user interface : yeah okay . so that 's already a very big change ye yeah . well uh no , i think oh . industrial designer : i d i did n't receive any information on speech recognition , marketing : uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said . we have to be original and uh technological innovative . becau user interface : i just i just received the industrial designer : yeah , uh i have i have some some information about the cost . but just a about the chip . marketing : and how much is the chip ? the the the industrial designer : i do n't know how much , but user interface : yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . marketing : and how how does it work ? is it user interface : does n't say . just you say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . because uh so it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . project manager : it does n't has to say anything . just you have to just talk to marketing : does it say does it say something back ?

<s> what did marketing think of making spongy remote when presenting the market trend ? </s> industrial designer : mm no . marketing : uh project manager : okay , we just talked about it looks . has to look nice . usability is very important . people do n't want to spend money on something that 's similar to cheaper ones . um it has to be very basic , not too many buttons . light switches on if you use a button . uh text tv still has to be a possibility . and it has to be easy to learn . that were the things i uh make minutes of . and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text tv button . that are the functions . that right ? industrial designer : yeah . project manager : okay . so i just want to give you uh mike again , the first uh presentation of your yeah . marketing : no . okay well i received an email okay . i searched the web , uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , i forget it . uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . so it 's very important for us to create something new . so what michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . uh this uh aspect is the most important one . uh it came out of the research . it uh is twice important as the following . the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we do n't make use of uh lcd or uh speech recognition . but um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and i think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . project manager : but we already have the flashing flashing light on the marketing : uh maybe maybe something new . user interface : well , i 'll i 'll get back on it . marketing : features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . and that 's very hard i think . uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . but uh that was an overall uh point . we already discussed that . um i 've got one picture . uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . so i took uh that part of the webpage . and it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . this trends i th uh trend i think it 's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . but it 's about uh clothes and shoes . user interface : spongy . marketing : but spongy , what what does spongy says ? industrial designer : spongy . user interface : spongy , like sponge . marketing : spongy . okay . industrial designer : so rubber , kind of . project manager : because you 've you 're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . so it has to be flexible . industrial designer : yeah , somewhat like project manager : is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? marketing : uh project manager : marketing : what do i think ? uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , i think about changeable fronts . industrial designer : user interface : yeah , i 'll get back on that . industrial designer : and it 's easy to implement . user interface : if we implement uh speech recognition , i think it would be better to implement lcd as well . marketing : oh . it 's mass production . so you can say , you can user interface : mm uh okay . and speech recognition ? industrial designer : i i have n't got anything about speech recognition , but user interface : yeah okay . so we well we can i had uh to make a sort of a design . so i did some searching on the internet . i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . i think we should um this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players . mobile phones . more modern . y yes . um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . and here you just have one , few buttons . so that 's that 's the main difference . but looks uh i definitely think we should go like this . and then changeable fonts , so it 's the most important part , i think . but and the home base is something like that , something simple . well and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit . uh basic buttons . on-off , mute . and th maybe two others , i dunno . text buttons . uh i do n't think it 's fits in the the modern theme as well . so and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the ipod . they can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . and uh f above ten . and i think project manager : yeah , that 's better . user interface : you mean uh these to the low ? oh okay . well , yeah . yeah , maybe it 's not easy if it 's below . it 's harder to zap . so i think uh it should be should be easy to . i think it 's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . i think it 's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . so the focus gets on these parts and not on there . but uh the position of course can be different . it 's s we have to look uh what 's easy to use , and how it 's easier to use . okay . yeah , maybe well that 's that 's my findings . so uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . m_p_ three player . and uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we i do n't think we should put it on top then . i think that , if we 're gon na put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's cool . user interface : to use industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . which wo n't look good on the front side i think . project manager : okay . user interface : so that 's something we have to decide on . industrial designer : okay , the component design . i looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . so uh this was on the web site . if you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . so flashy kinda colours . uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . not nothing square-like . project manager : okay , so hmm , okay . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . user interface : mm yeah , it 's industrial designer : yeah , mm n not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . no , okay . that 's a that 's a sen that 's just a matter of tastes , but well this is a remote control , a very old one . um then the components . the case has just a here 's black . project manager : yeah , we make it som maybe we have to make it from soft material . uh i 'm not sure . industrial designer : maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . we decided that , huh ?

<s> what did user interface recommend to do when discussing the technology innovation and why ? </s> marketing : industrial designer : marketing : uh maybe maybe something new . features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . and that 's very hard i think . uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . but uh that was an overall uh point . we already discussed that . um i 've got one picture . uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . user interface : spongy . marketing : but spongy , what what does spongy says ?

well then we can even simplify it more . by just putting the volume on the side . project manager : and the channels as well . user interface : and and just channel buttons here . industrial designer : yeah , or uh maybe uh the channel buttons are often used . and you ca n't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it 's not easy to control . project manager : yeah , just th th th other buttons like text tv . put that on the button bottom . mm-hmm . yeah . except from the on-off button . industrial designer : but i i think w you 'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . so maybe we can put that on the bottom . user interface : mm maybe . i dunno , but yeah we 'll yeah , maybe it 's not easy if it 's below . it 's harder to zap . so i think uh it should be should be easy to . i think it 's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . industrial designer : that 's that 's good , but user interface : so we can uh switch these to i dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . industrial designer : but uh we we can switch those two , user interface : to use so if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . which wo n't look good on the front side i think . so that 's something we have to decide on . industrial designer : yeah . and um sports and gaming device style characteristics . i do n't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of project manager : yeah , we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . user interface : mm yeah , it 's yeah , okay . uh ca n't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? can we do that ? so project manager : and still trans industrial designer : and user interface : yeah . but with all with logo on it . industrial designer : maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . we decided that , huh ? user interface : well one of the options . industrial designer : yeah , we could do that . marketing : yeah . the the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , i think is part of the remote control itself . it is in uh the c a remote control uh industrial designer : yeah , i know what you mean . so we have to keep it on the one level . like th the top it 's so if you put user interface : uh you can just make them around the buttons uh project manager : yeah , that 's right . user interface : uh depends on the colour of the project manager : you have to choose industrial designer : no , but i think there are multiple colour leds . so marketing : but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : 'cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . project manager : maybe put some different ones in it . does n't matter . it 's just no , just some led . industrial designer : um they they basically said that that 's almost the same on any uh remote controls . marketing : you can you can change yeah . no . industrial designer : yeah but project manager : but normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . user interface : so if you hold it , it gets powered . industrial designer : yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . so we ca n't use the flat buttons . project manager : but it does n't really matter , we just make it plastic . the scroll wheels , that 's cool . that 's for the volume . industrial designer : yeah , scroll wheels um yeah , that 's good . we can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . but i think just the volume is enough . user interface : uh for channels it 's not handy , because you scroll too fast . marketing : mm industrial designer : okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . so th so the regular chip . because we use scroll wheels . project manager : yeah , okay . user interface : so you can the the spongy yeah , i dunno . i ca n't imagine a soft remote control . industrial designer : you can make it curved or mm round . but just in two d_ , not in depth . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's right . yeah , re yeah , regular . yeah , okay . yeah , regular . but th think about something that 's more rounded . just and more it has to be user interface : yeah , uh i dunno . but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones . project manager : uh a bit . just just on the top or on the bottom . user interface : just a bit cur okay , i 'll see if i can see any of those . project manager : yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . industrial designer : i think uh you 'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it 's not wanted . user interface : that 's a little problem , of course , as well . project manager : and industrial designer : yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it wo n't change the volume . only if you use your finger . user interface : yeah , i agree as well . project manager : it does n't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . user interface : yeah , that 's right . project manager : so you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . because you have to hold it as well . industrial designer : or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . yeah , okay . user interface : and then you use those uh industrial designer : yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is if you put them project manager : yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . it ma it does n't make a big difference . industrial designer : but uh but i i think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . in uh on most on most remote controls . marketing : every remote control 's uh different . project manager : i dunno . i you already have the volume on the side , marketing : 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . user interface : you have to look at that image of the ipod . marketing : some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have user interface : where you can put a ve uh we have if we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . industrial designer : no , tha that will be project manager : so y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? is that is that a good good opportunity ? so you could put it like that , user interface : but th yeah , that can be very simple . least . marketing : yeah , we can b it c it could be just just a square , just a packet . industrial designer : of the remote control ? user interface : yeah , so y you do n't want uh this uh like the ipod . but project manager : no . yeah . yeah . no , just just the corners . user interface : yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . yeah okay , yeah well industrial designer : yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . i would do it like in this kind of shape or user interface : i think it will only look more like the old remote controls . curves , curves . industrial designer : yeah , okay . user interface : no rubber buttons or something . just together with the back-lights you 'll get a totally new look . more like the m_p_ three player m_ um p_ m_ p_ three player . project manager : but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? of skip that one as well . user interface : and industrial designer : okay . yeah , i d i do n't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . user interface : yeah , idea . but you 're if you look at the way remote controls are now and if you make it look like the ipod compared to industrial designer : yeah , we could do that . user interface : think the scroll wheel wo n't be very big . since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . so it will just be a small small scroll wheel . so it wo n't uh stick out much . so we can put all the project manager : the function of that in there . yeah . user interface : yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . no . yeah , it well that 's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that 's in it . well it it would be would be a good feature feature . </s>
<s> what did project manager think of the shape of the remote when discussing the remote and the recharger contact ? </s> industrial designer : yeah . yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : well , i 'll i 'll get back on it . marketing : features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . and that 's very hard i think . uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . but uh that was an overall uh point . we already discussed that . um i 've got one picture . uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . project manager : yeah . user interface : spongy . industrial designer : spongy . so rubber , kind of . project manager : because you 've you 're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . so it has to be flexible . is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ? marketing : uh project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah , i 'll get back on that . project manager : because it 's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control . user interface : th that 's the only problem . i d they do n't say how much it will cost , so um but uh marketing : yeah . but how uh we we 're gon na make many of those . so we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be . project manager : yeah , but a telephone okay , yeah . but a telephone also have a lcd and and it 's about t two hundred euros . user interface : yeah , so uh we got ta de marketing : yeah . okay . that was this ? industrial designer : it 's m the most expensive . yeah , it says in the email . the display requires an advanced chip . well it d that 's that 's the most expensive chip , we need . if we 're doing uh if we 're doing a display . user interface : no no . that th there is no display there . but it 's on the place of the display . and i think we should uh light this up much more than that part . project manager : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : i think it is on uh on the bottom too . user interface : you mean uh these to the low ? oh okay . well , yeah . industrial designer : yeah okay . user interface : i think it 's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . so the focus gets on these parts and not on there . industrial designer : yeah okay . yeah . but uh we we can switch those two , yeah . user interface : well that 's that 's my findings . so uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . m_p_ three player . and uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we i do n't think we should put it on top then . i think that , if we 're gon na put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's cool . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . which wo n't look good on the front side i think . so that 's something we have to decide on . yeah . what we 're gon na do . okay . mm yeah , it 's project manager : so we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . industrial designer : no , okay . that 's a that 's a sen that 's just a matter of tastes , but user interface : yeah . but with all with logo on it . industrial designer : maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . we decided that , huh ? user interface : well one of the options . so you can just replace them i think . that was the idea , project manager : it it could be like a nokia , like plastic . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , it 's it 's all on one level . yeah , on one level . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah , i know what you mean . so we have to keep it on the one level . like th the top it 's marketing : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? user interface : 'cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . industrial designer : yeah , but it i we do n't wan na have a ar an how do you call it ? accu . user interface : re recharger . base station . yeah , batteries . yes , rechargeable batteries , i think 's best . so if you hold it , it gets powered . project manager : yeah . definitely . industrial designer : yeah , i think . um these kinda materials can be used . but i think just the volume is enough . project manager : i do n't think that 's an opportunity . just skip it . because we do n't have time for that to to put it in . industrial designer : okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . so th so the regular chip . because we use scroll wheels . yeah , i it it should be soft . you said so ? so just hard plastic ? user interface : yeah , i think . titanium . it 's mentioned here uh . industrial designer : titanium , uh i think it 's too expensive . project manager : yeah . yeah , that 's right . so we have to decide which one we 're going to choose from these . what exactly . because we have to know it . so the energy uh is the recharger . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah , re yeah , regular . yeah , okay . yeah , regular . industrial designer : you have the simple one , regular and advanced . so it 's b should be regular uh the second . project manager : but you definitely get a specific instruction . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : but th think about something that 's more rounded . just and more it has to be user interface : yeah , uh i dunno . but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones . project manager : uh a bit . just just on the top or on the bottom . yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . user interface : that 's a little problem , of course , as well . industrial designer : i think it 's probably better . yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it wo n't change the volume . only if you use your finger . user interface : uh wh what is the middle part ? yeah , that 's right . project manager : so you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . because you have to hold it as well . user interface : and then you use those uh project manager : yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . it ma it does n't make a big difference . user interface : i think it 's s so simple project manager : so but that 's for that 's for you , marketing : yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . industrial designer : yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . project manager : uh yeah . so y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? is that is that a good good opportunity ? so you could put it like that , user interface : yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . curves , curves . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : does n't have to be . project manager : rubber spongy . marketing : spongy and fruity . project manager : i think it 's okay if you just keep it a bit square . industrial designer : okay . yeah , i d i do n't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . marketing : yeah . project manager : but i i think it 's still for older people . you j still have older people . it 's only annoying if it if it 's like that f formed like that , like f whatever . just you have a normal industrial designer : yeah , but we 're we 're aiming at a young public . user interface : yeah , idea . but you 're if you look at the way remote controls are now project manager : but i it is it is it is already fancy . because of the lights on the bottom of it . that 's already fancy . user interface : and if you make it look like the ipod marketing : yeah , they 're all the same . project manager : yeah . user interface : think the scroll wheel wo n't be very big . since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it will just be a small small scroll wheel . so it wo n't uh stick out much . marketing : uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said . we have to be original and uh technological innovative . becau project manager : the function of that in there . yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . marketing : does it say does it say something back ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis . we do n't expect the big banks to need these funds . before we provide any money , we 're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed , including internationally . mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . hon . carolyn bennett ( minister of crown-indigenous relations ) : i want to reassure the member that communication is ongoing with and between our partners on how to go forward on implementing the wet'suwet'en rights and title with a wet'suwet'en-led solution . we encourage the leaders to continue their ongoing , necessary and important conversations with their community on how they want to proceed on a path toward implementing their rights and title . as we work to rebuild canada 's relationship with the wet'suwet'en , we need to give them space for these important discussions . mr. jamie schmale : minister , is that a yes that the signing will be delayed until the elected chiefs have a chance to look at the agreement ? hon . carolyn bennett : i believe the elected chiefs have had a look at the agreement . these are very difficult conversations on complex issues around rights and title . this has been outstanding for a long time yet again , it 's very important the member understand the engagement must take place and be led by the wet'suwet'en nation . that means the elected chiefs and the hereditary chiefs need to work with all clan members as they determine how they wish to work with canada and the province of british columbia to implement the rights and title of the wet'suwet'en people . mr. jamie schmale : i agree that the wet'suwet'en should have the opportunity to look at the proposed agreement , but we are still seeing news coming out of the elected chiefs and the people they represent that they have not had a thorough chance to look at this proposed agreement . will the minister delay the signing ? hon . carolyn bennett : i think the member will agree that there 's a lot more work to do with all the parties . i believe , in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before covid-19 , that the work is under way and it will have to be wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title . i would have to disagree with the member . i do n't believe that there 's , at any time , an interest in shutting down discussion or debate . i think , though , that at the covid committee the issues facing indigenous communities , first nations , inuit and mtis around covid-19 are very important to them . we need to work with them to make sure they can keep their communities safe . again , in a committee , it is the work of the committee and the decision of the committee . i believe the chair and all members want first nations , inuit and mtis to be able to keep their communities safe during covid-19 . hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . hon . judy a. sgro : thank you very much , mr. chair . i want to applaud the minister for that work . i know she 's been working extremely hard to make sure that we get some additional announcements over and above all of the ones we have already made , so congratulations . keep up the work . you know there is lots more we want to do . mr. brian masse : what changes are on the table ? hon . chrystia freeland : i found during the nafta negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public , but let me just assure canadians that the health and safety of canadians is first and foremost . our government is taking a cautious approach , and we 're working effectively . let me just say that i think the honourable member was actually seeking to know what exactly is being discussed with our american partners . let me just say that we are taking a very cautious approach to the health and safety of canadians . a very collaborative discussion is happening . hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr.chair , we are continuing to work towards that end . it is always very important to protect canadians , and we are going to stick to that approach . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr.chair , i 'd like to thank the member for his question . i fully understand , as we all do , the important role processors play in our system and our country . i can assure the members of the house that we will continue to work with canadian processors as the agreement comes into force . mr. corey tochor : was there something in particular that this government did not want canadians to know about the cottage , or is secrecy all this government knows how to do ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , this information was and has been public since 2018. there is no effort to hide any information from the public in this regard . hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , my hon . colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the covid crisis is deeply problematic , and we want to make sure that any information we share with the canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process . the breach that occurred is completely unacceptable . our government has denounced this breach . that breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information . the member has alluded to several paragraphs within the statistics act . i can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that statistics canada is looking into this issue as well . going forward , we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again , because it 's important that we continue to have the confidence of canadians during this current health care crisis . mr. ziad aboultaif : in that case , the minister said the matter will be looked into . basically , my understanding of this case is that statistics canada is going to investigate itself , or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the rcmp ? hon . navdeep bains : mr. chair , there are appropriate protocols in place to look into such breaches . those protocols will be followed , and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward . mr. ziad aboultaif : the minister indicated that this will be investigated , but during the investigation into the snc-lavalin scandal , the liberal staff refused to co-operate . will the minister commit today that all liberal staff will co-operate with this investigation ? hon . navdeep bains : the process is very clear . the protocols are very clear . the law is very clear , and we will make sure that the process is followed and the law is upheld . hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , we know that our oil and gas sector is suffering through two crises . we have the impacts of covid and the effects of a global price war , and we have been tackling both of these on each front . on april 17 , we announced liquidity measures to support the small and medium-sized players . that made up 85 % of the jobs in this sector . we have announced liquidity will be further made available to larger players . as well , through the bcap , we are making sure that more companies are eligible so that they can remain whole and so they can hold onto the jobs that we need . hon . navdeep bains : i 'd like to thank the member for her question . i 'm working very closely with minister hajdu and the chief science advisor to look at all options . i 'm glad the member highlighted the ebola virus vaccine , which was developed here in canada . i 'm proud of the fact that the dna sequencing for sars was also done in canada . we have incredible scientists and researchers . we are engaging with them and empowering them , and we will continue to share details of this with the public . hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? hon . jonathan wilkinson : of course , the issues of the future are very important . that means not just climate change , but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis , challenges we need to take into account . now , i think canadians want us to take the time to focus on what is currently going on . we have put rules in place to protect canadians . we really need to think about this . we need a plan . of course , we need to think about the future , but i want canadians mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . the chair : there 's a point of order . the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . we have another point of order . mr.guilbeault now has the floor . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about petitions fraudulence , tax evasion , violence handling and their supervisory . </s> ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people . we have moved forward , both through the minister of indigenous services and the minister of crown-indigenous relations , to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations . we will continue to work with them , recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government , and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years . hon . candice bergen ( portagelisgar , cpc ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . mr. chair , i 'm hearing in my riding of portagelisgar that individuals who are dealing with service canada through the mail are experiencing delays . it seems that the mail that 's going to service canada has not been opened . in fact , one of my constituents sent documents , including a doctor 's note , two months ago on march 12 and is now being told that she must resend them because they 've never been opened . can the government tell us whether this is a widespread problem , and how are they dealing with unopened mail at service canada ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . candice bergen : is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem ? is this happening rarely , or frequently ? i 'm hearing about it . i know , from many mps , we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to covid-19 . is unopened mail a widespread problem at service canada ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . i just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the canadian firearms program , with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes , models and variants of nine rifles , all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use , for soldiers to use in combat . those are the weapons that have been hon . candice bergen : mr. chair , we 've seen this before , where the liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes . this is a repeat of what the liberals have done before . is the minister saying that the iver johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle ? hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : yes or no : did the canada revenue agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job , i 'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected ? mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . mr. chris d'entremont : my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? the chair : mr.savard-tremblay , the floor is now yours . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go on with questions , but i 'll also just ask mr. blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name . let 's go now to mr. masse for windsor west . go ahead , mr. masse . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed . let me be very clear that this is his assertion ; i have not said that . hon . bill morneau : thank you , mr. chair . i would like to say that we recognize the challenges that canadians face , especially with issues like credit card rates . that 's exactly why we 've been working on this issue since we came into office . we came to an agreement on interchange fees that was important for consumers . most recently , during the covid-19 crisis , we 've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them , and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant , and deferrals for customers the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : there 's time for one more short question . go ahead , mr. masse . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : yes , thank you , chair . the point i was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with covid-19 . changing gears onto cerb , who came up with the number for cerb ? why is it $ 2,000 ? a senior gets $ 1,200 , people with disabilities get $ 1,600 , and now we 've added another ad hoc program on top of those . i 'd like to know a little more about how and who came up with those unique numbers . hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , my hon . colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the covid crisis is deeply problematic , and we want to make sure that any information we share with the canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process . the breach that occurred is completely unacceptable . our government has denounced this breach . that breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information . the member has alluded to several paragraphs within the statistics act . i can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that statistics canada is looking into this issue as well . going forward , we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again , because it 's important that we continue to have the confidence of canadians during this current health care crisis . hon . navdeep bains : as i have indicated very clearly , what has happened is completely unacceptable . this breach should not have occurred . this matter is being looked into , and we want to assure canadians going forward that again , we 've been clear that it 's important that any such breach be taken seriously . what has happened is unacceptable , and we will ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to make sure that such breaches do not occur going forward . mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , we have seen junior oil companies close their doors . the larger companies have sent contractors home and laid off employees . many of these contractors are indigenous companies , and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses . can the honourable minister of crown-indigenous relations inform us of the measures the government is taking to ensure there are no gaps in the current programs , and commit to review the eligibility criteria for owners of aboriginal businesses struggling to qualify for financial help ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ? the chair : the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . mr. alexis brunelle-duceppe : mr.chair , because the ministers chose to answer in french owing to a technical issue , their answers were unduly drawn out , which cost my fellow member speaking time . i think he should be given a chance to ask one last question , to be fair . otherwise , french speakers are going to be at a major disadvantage . </s>
<s> what did mr. gabriel ste-marie mean by saying that the prime minister continued to support the profiteers ? </s> mr. gord johns ( courtenayalberni , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . it 's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512 , which was signed by 1,198 petitioners , primarily from the province of nova scotia . the province of nova scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations . the petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation , as seen in similar aquaculture operations in british columbia , newfoundland , norway , vietnam and elsewhere in the world . it also , they cite , would pose risks to native fish stocks , pollute coastal ecosystems , impair at-risk wild atlantic salmon , and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations . they also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries . they are calling on the government to uphold bill c-68 and species-at-risk legislation , protect our oceans , ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans , work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and , lastly , invest in land-based , closed-containment finfish aquaculture . i want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans , for their local economy and for the well-being of nova scotia . ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we have been focused entirely on getting help to canadians when they need it , and that has meant that yes , there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix , but getting that help into canadians ' pockets during this pandemic was our priority . mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation . of course , there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well . i know that the honourable member would n't want to inadvertently mislead the house . the fact is , the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources , hundreds of millions of dollars , to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities , including renting new spaces , to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19 . i recognize there 's always more to do , but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy , we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable canadians , and we will continue to do that . mr. chair , we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people . we have moved forward , both through the minister of indigenous services and the minister of crown-indigenous relations , to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations . we will continue to work with them , recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government , and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . mr. chris d'entremont : my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go on with questions , but i 'll also just ask mr. blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name . let 's go now to mr. masse for windsor west . go ahead , mr. masse . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . hon . bill morneau : thank you , mr. chair . i would like to say that we recognize the challenges that canadians face , especially with issues like credit card rates . that 's exactly why we 've been working on this issue since we came into office . we came to an agreement on interchange fees that was important for consumers . most recently , during the covid-19 crisis , we 've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them , and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant , and deferrals for customers mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i 'd like to thank the member for his question . i fully understand , as we all do , the important role processors play in our system and our country . i can assure the members of the house that we will continue to work with canadian processors as the agreement comes into force . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : respectfully to the minister , you 're letting down canadians . people are being stranded , and you need to do better as a government . changing gears a little , all canadians would agree , or can agree , that the prime minister requires suitable accommodation . why did the government simply not tell canadians that the harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded ? hon . ahmed hussen : mr. chair , we understand the important role that charities and non-profits are playing to help vulnerable canadians at this difficult time . we have announced supports in the amount of $ 350 million to ensure that not only do they continue that great work , but also expand it to serve the most vulnerable to get through the covid-19 pandemic . mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : mr. chair , i 'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector . these measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed , and this is also the liquidity that they asked for . it was on april 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry , and those are the ones in which 85 % of workers are affected . today 's measures will complete that . i 'm very happy that we 've had such people as the canadian association of petroleum producers come out and say that this is what they asked for and this is what they need , and we have produced what they need in order to ensure the future competitiveness of canada 's oil and gas sector . hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? ms. elizabeth may : changing gears , we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial . it 's very clear to me as an opposition member why we have n't seen legislation on any fast track . it 's obviously not the sort of legislation that would gain unanimous consent . would n't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we 're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? mr. mario simard ( jonquire , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . a few weeks ago , the prime minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy . ministerguilbeault , ministermckenna and ministerwilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that . today , i worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell , a convenient post-crisis political pitch . on the natural resources front , the government 's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels . we need only think of the $ 1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells . perhaps there is an environmental component , but i 'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday 's announcement by export and development canada . it 's going to lend tc energy $ 500million to build its coastal gaslink pipeline . that 's $ 500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually . how does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy ? mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . </s>
<s> why did hon . bill blair support banning iver johnson ? </s> mr. gord johns ( courtenayalberni , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . it 's a huge honour to table e-petition 2512 , which was signed by 1,198 petitioners , primarily from the province of nova scotia . the province of nova scotia invited multinational companies to scope out and develop expansive open-net salmon farming operations . the petitioners cite that the expansion would increase environmental degradation , as seen in similar aquaculture operations in british columbia , newfoundland , norway , vietnam and elsewhere in the world . it also , they cite , would pose risks to native fish stocks , pollute coastal ecosystems , impair at-risk wild atlantic salmon , and threaten established fisheries and tourism operations . they also raise concerns that open-net fish farming would not create significant employment and would undermine existing lobster and other fisheries . they are calling on the government to uphold bill c-68 and species-at-risk legislation , protect our oceans , ban expansion of open-net finfish aquaculture in our oceans , work to phase out any existing open-net fish farming operations currently in place and , lastly , invest in land-based , closed-containment finfish aquaculture . i want to thank these petitioners for fighting for clean oceans , for their local economy and for the well-being of nova scotia . ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. chair , the prime minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage . we 're asking a very simple question here . will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud , the fraud will be pursued ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : i know that the honourable member would n't want to inadvertently mislead the house . the fact is , the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources , hundreds of millions of dollars , to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities , including renting new spaces , to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19 . i recognize there 's always more to do , but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy , we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable canadians , and we will continue to do that . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . hon . carolyn bennett : i would have to disagree with the member . i do n't believe that there 's , at any time , an interest in shutting down discussion or debate . i think , though , that at the covid committee the issues facing indigenous communities , first nations , inuit and mtis around covid-19 are very important to them . we need to work with them to make sure they can keep their communities safe . mr. chris d'entremont : my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? mr. simon-pierre savard-tremblay ( saint-hyacinthebagot , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . despite all the upheaval it causes , the crisis we are experiencing , considerable in scope though it is , can also be an opportunity to begin a transition . what is essential in normal times may , during a crisis , become crucial . what is unjust may , in times of crisis , become frankly scandalous . in quebec , we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality . yesterday , ottawa announced new support for large companies . many of us in quebec feel that , when a company knocks on the state 's door to ask for assistance , it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support . we in the bloc qubcois feel that there should be a limit , a ceiling , on the assistance provided to large companies , in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation . that is also the prevalent position in quebec . a few years ago , after the bombardier affair in quebeci will not dwell on that because quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the national assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind . a number of civil society groups in quebec share it also . the united states , which , you will agree , is no bastion of socialism , has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis . the idea is to offer support , but with conditions . according to a report published by the canadian centre for policy alternatives on january2 , the 100highest-paid ceos in canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker . the average salary for workers increased by 2.6 % between 2017 and 2018. given that inflation was then at 2.3 % , it can be said that there was practically no increase . by contrast , the salary increase for ceos in the same period was 18 % , even in cases where the companies suffered losses . let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted . we can not even imagine what the figures are today . at this point , we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss . wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid , but clearly does not flow down to the base . does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis ? the question is clear and i am asking you to give me a clear answer . if i do n't get one , i am going to have to demand a new version of the clarity act . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go on with questions , but i 'll also just ask mr. blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name . let 's go now to mr. masse for windsor west . go ahead , mr. masse . mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) : during the covid-19 pandemic , the state of michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak . the city of detroit alone has more deaths than the entire province of ontario . the border communities of sarnia and windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province . next week , the border restrictions between the u.s. and canada expire . with the premiers of b.c. , quebec and ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time , will the restrictions be extended , or is the prime minister discussing changing the restrictions ? hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , my hon . colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the covid crisis is deeply problematic , and we want to make sure that any information we share with the canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process . the breach that occurred is completely unacceptable . our government has denounced this breach . that breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information . the member has alluded to several paragraphs within the statistics act . i can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that statistics canada is looking into this issue as well . going forward , we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again , because it 's important that we continue to have the confidence of canadians during this current health care crisis . hon . navdeep bains : as i have indicated very clearly , what has happened is completely unacceptable . this breach should not have occurred . this matter is being looked into , and we want to assure canadians going forward that mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? ms. elizabeth may : changing gears , we know that the new regulations limiting what are described as military-style assault rifles and guns have been very controversial . it 's very clear to me as an opposition member why we have n't seen legislation on any fast track . it 's obviously not the sort of legislation that would gain unanimous consent . would n't it be wise to table for first reading the entire legislative framework so that we know what we 're talking about in the long term with regard to the buyback program and other aspects of this issue ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , certainly the member of parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing . i do n't think that 's the case at all . as a matter of fact , what i hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how , first of all , we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? mr. mario simard ( jonquire , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . a few weeks ago , the prime minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy . ministerguilbeault , ministermckenna and ministerwilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that . today , i worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell , a convenient post-crisis political pitch . on the natural resources front , the government 's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels . we need only think of the $ 1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells . perhaps there is an environmental component , but i 'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday 's announcement by export and development canada . it 's going to lend tc energy $ 500million to build its coastal gaslink pipeline . that 's $ 500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually . how does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy ? hon . jonathan wilkinson ( north vancouver , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . thank you very much for the question . certainly at this time , canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent . we are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in canada . that is the primary focus of the government , as it is of canadians . certainly as we move forward , we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future . in that context , we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience , and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon , including the challenge of climate change . those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis , but at the current time , the focus is clearly on combatting the virus . hon . jonathan wilkinson : of course , the issues of the future are very important . that means not just climate change , but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis , challenges we need to take into account . now , i think canadians want us to take the time to focus on what is currently going on . we have put rules in place to protect canadians . we really need to think about this . we need a plan . of course , we need to think about the future , but i want canadians mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , first of all , we share the member 's concern that small businesses be supported . that 's why we 've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance . with respect to rent support , we are encouraging landlords to support this measure . obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction . at every opportunity i talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there . we will continue to support small businesses . we believe this program has significant merit . it allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75 % of the rent . we think it is an excellent program . it will require the provinces to step forward and enforce it . the chair : the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about government support for the elderly and for vulnerable people . </s> mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , in this unprecedented situation canadians have lost their jobs ; they 've lost their paycheques ; they do n't know how they 're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries . we made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority . mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? ms. jenny kwan ( vancouver east , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . instead of providing a universal direct payment for all , the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind . a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to covid-19 . she pays taxes on her spousal income , but she is not eligible for cerb . the minister of employment said that she is looking into this gap . it has been weeks , and still no action . will the prime minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people . we have moved forward , both through the minister of indigenous services and the minister of crown-indigenous relations , to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations . we will continue to work with them , recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government , and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . candice bergen : is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem ? is this happening rarely , or frequently ? i 'm hearing about it . i know , from many mps , we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to covid-19 . is unopened mail a widespread problem at service canada ? hon . bill blair ( minister of public safety and emergency preparedness ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . i just wish to advise the member that we worked very closely with the canadian firearms program , with law enforcement and with their firearms verification to identify the makes , models and variants of nine rifles , all of which had in their earliest provenance a design for military use , for soldiers to use in combat . those are the weapons that have been hon . candice bergen : i would challenge the minister on that . i do not believe that he has been consulting with front-line officers . we 're hearing from front-line officers that they are concerned about gangs , drug dealers and illegal weapons being smuggled across the border . they are not concerned with these types of farm rifles that are being used by our farmers and , in some cases , hunters . these are specifically used for hunting . so , mr. chair , we 'd like to see the evidence on why the liberals are once again targeting law-abiding canadians , ignoring gangsters and drug dealers . why are they banning the iver johnson ? hon . bill blair : it 's a great opportunity , i think , when the member opposite says what the police are saying . let 's hear what the police are saying . the canadian association of chiefs of police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles , except for law enforcement and military purposes . the ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles . they said , in our view , these weapons have no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by canada 's military and law enforcement . hon . candice bergen : mr. chair , we 've seen this before , where the liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes . this is a repeat of what the liberals have done before . is the minister saying that the iver johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle ? hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . mr. brian masse ( windsor west , ndp ) : during the covid-19 pandemic , the state of michigan has become an epicentre of the outbreak . the city of detroit alone has more deaths than the entire province of ontario . the border communities of sarnia and windsor have higher per capita infection rates than the rest of the province . next week , the border restrictions between the u.s. and canada expire . with the premiers of b.c. , quebec and ontario opposing the opening of the border at this time , will the restrictions be extended , or is the prime minister discussing changing the restrictions ? hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed . let me be very clear that this is his assertion ; i have not said that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? mr. bruce stanton : ms. joly , you have to switch to the french channel and turn on your microphone . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : continuing with questions , we 'll go to the honourable member for saskatoonuniversity , mr. tochor . hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : respectfully to the minister , you 're letting down canadians . people are being stranded , and you need to do better as a government . changing gears a little , all canadians would agree , or can agree , that the prime minister requires suitable accommodation . why did the government simply not tell canadians that the harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded ? hon . anita anand : the ncc is an independent crown corporation . it recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over . the work at harrington lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under ncc management , and we will support the ncc in its important work . mr. corey tochor : yes , thank you , chair . the point i was making was about transparency or lack of transparency that is hurting our efforts with covid-19 . changing gears onto cerb , who came up with the number for cerb ? why is it $ 2,000 ? a senior gets $ 1,200 , people with disabilities get $ 1,600 , and now we 've added another ad hoc program on top of those . i 'd like to know a little more about how and who came up with those unique numbers . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : mr. aboultaif , you have about a minute left . go ahead . mr. ziad aboultaif : the minister indicated that this will be investigated , but during the investigation into the snc-lavalin scandal , the liberal staff refused to co-operate . will the minister commit today that all liberal staff will co-operate with this investigation ? mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and , in fact , municipal governments , which often run them and fund them partially as well . that 's why it 's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners , but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country , including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times , to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life , safety and dignity in their elder years . mr. chair , certainly the member of parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing . i do n't think that 's the case at all . as a matter of fact , what i hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how , first of all , we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , first of all , we share the member 's concern that small businesses be supported . that 's why we 've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance . with respect to rent support , we are encouraging landlords to support this measure . obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction . at every opportunity i talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there . we will continue to support small businesses . we believe this program has significant merit . it allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75 % of the rent . we think it is an excellent program . it will require the provinces to step forward and enforce it . hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ? the chair : the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . hon . steven guilbeault : i hope the member is n't suggesting that , because some members of the house are making an effort to speak french , they are unduly dragging out the time , as he seems to have said . good for them , i say , for trying to speak a language they are n't necessarily comfortable in for the benefit of other members . </s>
<s> what did ms. jenny kwan mean by saying there was a gap between program making and its implementation ? </s> ms. heather mcpherson ( edmonton strathcona , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . world maternal mental health day took place last week , and today i 'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the canadian perinatal mental health collaborative . whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication , whereas in canada and worldwide 20 % of women and 10 % of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness , resulting in an annual economic cost to canada of approximately $ 11 billion , and whereas the u.k. , australia and parts of the u.s. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and canada does not , the canadian perinatal mental health collaborative is calling upon the house of commons in parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction , policy and funding to develop specialized , comprehensive perinatal mental health care services , which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period . ms. elizabeth may ( saanichgulf islands , gp ) : thank you , mr. chair . it 's an honour to take the mike today , with all colleagues here . it 's good to see you all virtually and safe . petitioners in my community point out in this petition , which , of course , predates the pandemic , that the family doctor shortage is severe in this country . nearly five million canadians lack a regular family doctor . this problem is particularly profound in more rural areas , including , as the petitioners reference , the community in which i live , sydney , british columbia . we have a very significant crisis and a lack of family doctors . the petitioners call on the government to work with provinces and territories to find a collaborative , holistic solution so that every canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage . ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : our focus has been on helping as many people as we possible can . our decision from the very beginning was to get the help out to people and figure out , with retroactive action if necessary , where and when there may have been fraudulent use . our priority was getting that help out . again , in this unprecedented situation , our focus has been on helping as many people as possible , as quickly as possible . other parties might have made a different choice had they been in government , but our focus was getting help to people when they needed it as quickly as possible and cleaning it up afterwards . mr. chair , we have been focused entirely on getting help to canadians when they need it , and that has meant that yes , there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix , but getting that help into canadians ' pockets during this pandemic was our priority . mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. chair , the prime minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage . we 're asking a very simple question here . will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud , the fraud will be pursued ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we recognize there is more to do in supporting urban indigenous people . we have moved forward , both through the minister of indigenous services and the minister of crown-indigenous relations , to address the challenges facing urban aboriginal populations . we will continue to work with them , recognizing that they are among the most vulnerable people in canada who deserve the right support from all orders of government , and we will be there to support them increasingly in the coming years . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . candice bergen : is the minister aware whether this is a widespread problem ? is this happening rarely , or frequently ? i 'm hearing about it . i know , from many mps , we are at the front lines of dealing with and helping constituents who are not only wanting to get support but also are trying to get programs unrelated to covid-19 . is unopened mail a widespread problem at service canada ? hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . hon . carolyn bennett : i think the member will agree that there 's a lot more work to do with all the parties . i believe , in terms of the kind of engagement that has taken place in the feast houses and the notification that took place even before covid-19 , that the work is under way and it will have to be wet'suwet'en-led in terms of what eventually will be their choice as to how they implement their rights and title . mr. chris d'entremont : my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? hon . patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . my heart goes out to the family of chantelle , who are obviously suffering an unbearable loss . i agree with the member that we want to make sure that effective drugs are available in canada . as the member has pointed out , vertex has not applied to sell trikafta in canada . however , there is the special access program that makes drugs like trikafta available . in fact , the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access . i would encourage the member to continue his correspondence with the manufacturer , as will we . hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . mr. simon-pierre savard-tremblay ( saint-hyacinthebagot , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . despite all the upheaval it causes , the crisis we are experiencing , considerable in scope though it is , can also be an opportunity to begin a transition . what is essential in normal times may , during a crisis , become crucial . what is unjust may , in times of crisis , become frankly scandalous . in quebec , we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality . yesterday , ottawa announced new support for large companies . many of us in quebec feel that , when a company knocks on the state 's door to ask for assistance , it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support . we in the bloc qubcois feel that there should be a limit , a ceiling , on the assistance provided to large companies , in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation . that is also the prevalent position in quebec . a few years ago , after the bombardier affair in quebeci will not dwell on that because quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the national assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind . a number of civil society groups in quebec share it also . the united states , which , you will agree , is no bastion of socialism , has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis . the idea is to offer support , but with conditions . according to a report published by the canadian centre for policy alternatives on january2 , the 100highest-paid ceos in canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker . the average salary for workers increased by 2.6 % between 2017 and 2018. given that inflation was then at 2.3 % , it can be said that there was practically no increase . by contrast , the salary increase for ceos in the same period was 18 % , even in cases where the companies suffered losses . let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted . we can not even imagine what the figures are today . at this point , we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss . wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid , but clearly does not flow down to the base . does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis ? the question is clear and i am asking you to give me a clear answer . if i do n't get one , i am going to have to demand a new version of the clarity act . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : we 'll go on with questions , but i 'll also just ask mr. blois to excuse me for mispronouncing his name . let 's go now to mr. masse for windsor west . go ahead , mr. masse . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , my hon . colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the covid crisis is deeply problematic , and we want to make sure that any information we share with the canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process . the breach that occurred is completely unacceptable . our government has denounced this breach . that breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information . the member has alluded to several paragraphs within the statistics act . i can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that statistics canada is looking into this issue as well . going forward , we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again , because it 's important that we continue to have the confidence of canadians during this current health care crisis . hon . navdeep bains : sorry , could you repeat that question ? i had a bit of an issue and could not hear the question . mr. chair , there are appropriate protocols in place to look into such breaches . those protocols will be followed , and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward . mr. ziad aboultaif : the minister indicated that this will be investigated , but during the investigation into the snc-lavalin scandal , the liberal staff refused to co-operate . will the minister commit today that all liberal staff will co-operate with this investigation ? mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. chair , the member has illustrated some of the horror stories that have appalled us all as canadians and certainly as parliamentarians . we know that seniors deserve to live in dignity and safety with the utmost care , and that just has n't been happening in this time of covid and certainly , in some cases , in previous times as well . as the member knows , i 've said publicly that i believe we need to hold long-term care homes to stronger standards . i have begun those preliminary conversations with my counterparts . i am working with many ministers across our government to think about how we do that , how we mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and , in fact , municipal governments , which often run them and fund them partially as well . that 's why it 's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners , but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country , including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times , to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life , safety and dignity in their elder years . mr. chair , certainly the member of parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing . i do n't think that 's the case at all . as a matter of fact , what i hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how , first of all , we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? hon . jonathan wilkinson ( north vancouver , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . thank you very much for the question . certainly at this time , canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent . we are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in canada . that is the primary focus of the government , as it is of canadians . certainly as we move forward , we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future . in that context , we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience , and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon , including the challenge of climate change . those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis , but at the current time , the focus is clearly on combatting the virus . hon . jonathan wilkinson : of course , the issues of the future are very important . that means not just climate change , but also other challenges that we saw during the coronavirus crisis , challenges we need to take into account . now , i think canadians want us to take the time to focus on what is currently going on . we have put rules in place to protect canadians . we really need to think about this . we need a plan . of course , we need to think about the future , but i want canadians hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that the chair : the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . </s>
<s> what did the canadian government do to support the elderly . </s> mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation . of course , there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well . ms. jenny kwan ( vancouver east , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . instead of providing a universal direct payment for all , the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind . a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to covid-19 . she pays taxes on her spousal income , but she is not eligible for cerb . the minister of employment said that she is looking into this gap . it has been weeks , and still no action . will the prime minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic ? ms. jenny kwan : i would remind the prime minister that it was the federal liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993 , so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the liberals . we in vancouver east have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country , yet we got less than 2 % of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding . they 're overrepresented among the homeless population . why ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . hon . chrystia freeland : i found during the nafta negotiations that negotiations are best not conducted in public , but let me just assure canadians that the health and safety of canadians is first and foremost . our government is taking a cautious approach , and we 're working effectively . i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed . let me be very clear that this is his assertion ; i have not said that . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . mr. brian masse : will you use your statutory powers , yes or no , to do what vancity has done to help canadian consumers ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr. brian masse : will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than vancity 's ? mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , when it comes to the covid-19 crisis , what canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed internet will have fared better , feeling less financial strain , than those who are cut off from the rest of the world . is the government ready to invest in making high-speed internet available to all canadians , no matter where they live in the country ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? mr. bruce stanton : ms. joly , you have to switch to the french channel and turn on your microphone . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : respectfully to the minister , you 're letting down canadians . people are being stranded , and you need to do better as a government . changing gears a little , all canadians would agree , or can agree , that the prime minister requires suitable accommodation . why did the government simply not tell canadians that the harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded ? hon . anita anand : the ncc is an independent crown corporation . it recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over . the work at harrington lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under ncc management , and we will support the ncc in its important work . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . navdeep bains : as i have indicated very clearly , what has happened is completely unacceptable . this breach should not have occurred . this matter is being looked into , and we want to assure canadians going forward that mr. chair , there are appropriate protocols in place to look into such breaches . those protocols will be followed , and the appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such breaches do not occur going forward . hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ?

mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ?

<s> summarize the discussion about government support for energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses . </s> ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. chair , in this unprecedented situation canadians have lost their jobs ; they 've lost their paycheques ; they do n't know how they 're going to be able to support their loved ones and pay for their groceries . we made a decision as a country that we would be there for them and that has been and will continue to be our priority . mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers . we have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need . we 're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers . right now , we 're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis . that 's what we 'll continue to focus on . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . hon . candice bergen : mr. chair , we 've seen this before , where the liberals introduced a long-gun registry that cost billions of dollars and did absolutely nothing to stop violent crimes . this is a repeat of what the liberals have done before . is the minister saying that the iver johnson that farmers use is an assault rifle ? hon . bill blair : actually , what i 'm saying , and what our regulations say very clearly , is that weapons that were designed not for hunting and not for sport purposes but for soldiers to use in combat to kill other soldiers have no place in canadian society . i would also advise the member that any canadian killed by gun violence is one too many . we have far too many tragedies where these types of weapons have been used to kill canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : yes or no : did the canada revenue agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job , i 'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected ? mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough ( minister of employment , workforce development and disability inclusion ) : mr. chair , i can clarify that service canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the cerb to the wage subsidy or from the cerb back to employment to ensure that there 's no overpayment , but of course that there 's no undue hardship on the individual . hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mrs. stephanie kusie : nearly two months into living in some form of isolation , watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the covid-19 pandemic , eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $ 500 . why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else ? hon . bernadette jordan ( minister of fisheries , oceans and the canadian coast guard ) : thank you , mr. chair . i thank my colleague for that very good question . we know that the fish and seafood sector has been extremely adversely affected because of covid-19 . we 've started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $ 62.5 million for processors , as well as to make sure that the cerb is available for seasonal workers as well as people who have run out of their fishery ei , but we know that more needs to be done . the fishery enterprises are uniquely structured , which is why we 're looking at measures to address the concerns they have . i 'm working with my provincial colleagues , as well as my caucus colleagues . mr. chris d'entremont : mr. chair , most fishermen are not eligible for the wage subsidy program due to the stipulation that it can not be used for employees who are related to their employer . most fishing enterprises , like farm enterprises , are family oriented . many fishermen have their wives , their sons , their uncles or their fathers working for them , and sometimes it 's the whole family on the boat . can the minister explain what the government 's plan is to support fishermen who do not fit into any actual program and who desperately need direct financial help from the federal government to survive ? my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? hon . patty hajdu ( minister of health ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . my heart goes out to the family of chantelle , who are obviously suffering an unbearable loss . i agree with the member that we want to make sure that effective drugs are available in canada . as the member has pointed out , vertex has not applied to sell trikafta in canada . however , there is the special access program that makes drugs like trikafta available . in fact , the majority of people who have applied through the special access program to get access to the drug have received access . i would encourage the member to continue his correspondence with the manufacturer , as will we . hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . hon . marie-claude bibeau : thank you , mr. chair . we are targeting support to some of the most critical challenges facing the food supply chain . last tuesday i was proud to announce our emergency processing fund for a total of $ 77.5 million , $ 50 million for the surplus food program and $ 125 million through agrirecovery to support our beef and pork producers . concerning the dairy sector in particular , i 'm hopeful that tomorrow we will get the support of all of the parties to be able to respond to their request for an increase in their loan capacity from $ 300 million to $ 500 million . i would like to encourage all farmers to apply to the business risk management programs , including agristability , for which we have improved some of the mechanisms . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. brian masse : apparently , we 're meeting for nothing . i 'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing canadians during this public crisis . credit card interest rates are still high from previous price-gouging levels . despite numerous favours from the liberals , there have not been significant changes . vancity savings credit union demonstrated leadership when it set credit card rates at zero . will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that vancity has already done ? hon . bill morneau : thank you , mr. chair . i would like to say that we recognize the challenges that canadians face , especially with issues like credit card rates . that 's exactly why we 've been working on this issue since we came into office . we came to an agreement on interchange fees that was important for consumers . most recently , during the covid-19 crisis , we 've negotiated with the banks and encouraged them , and they have come out with reductions in their credit card fees that are significant , and deferrals for customers mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan ( minister of natural resources ) : mr. chair , i 'm happy that we were able to announce today some liquidity measures for large cap corporations in the oil and gas sector . these measures will provide them with the liquidity that they needed , and this is also the liquidity that they asked for . it was on april 17 that we started liquidity measures for small and medium-sized businesses in the oil and gas industry , and those are the ones in which 85 % of workers are affected . today 's measures will complete that . i 'm very happy that we 've had such people as the canadian association of petroleum producers come out and say that this is what they asked for and this is what they need , and we have produced what they need in order to ensure the future competitiveness of canada 's oil and gas sector . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , we have seen junior oil companies close their doors . the larger companies have sent contractors home and laid off employees . many of these contractors are indigenous companies , and they are having a difficult time qualifying for programs to save their businesses . can the honourable minister of crown-indigenous relations inform us of the measures the government is taking to ensure there are no gaps in the current programs , and commit to review the eligibility criteria for owners of aboriginal businesses struggling to qualify for financial help ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? mr. chair , the government 's assistance package for the canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry . the lack of detail and action has led to some challenges . can the minister clarify ? on a medium-sized energy company 's eligibility , if the company is in default to financial institutions , does it still qualify for the business credit availability program ? ms. elizabeth may : as a follow-up to the minister 's comment , i note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in winnipeg on an ebola vaccine . because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product , it is alleged that the ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model . i wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs . is that a conversation the minister is having with others ? hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? mr. mario simard ( jonquire , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . a few weeks ago , the prime minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy . ministerguilbeault , ministermckenna and ministerwilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that . today , i worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell , a convenient post-crisis political pitch . on the natural resources front , the government 's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels . we need only think of the $ 1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells . perhaps there is an environmental component , but i 'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday 's announcement by export and development canada . it 's going to lend tc energy $ 500million to build its coastal gaslink pipeline . that 's $ 500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually . how does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy ? mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . </s>
<s> what was the current situation of the tourism sector and what was the government going to do ? </s> ms. heather mcpherson ( edmonton strathcona , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . world maternal mental health day took place last week , and today i 'd like to take a moment to present a very important petition on behalf of the canadian perinatal mental health collaborative . whereas perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common obstetrical complication , whereas in canada and worldwide 20 % of women and 10 % of men suffer from a perinatal mental illness , resulting in an annual economic cost to canada of approximately $ 11 billion , and whereas the u.k. , australia and parts of the u.s. have perinatal mental health strategies and screening guidelines in place and canada does not , the canadian perinatal mental health collaborative is calling upon the house of commons in parliament assembled to create a national perinatal mental health strategy that will provide direction , policy and funding to develop specialized , comprehensive perinatal mental health care services , which include universal screening and timely access to treatment for all women and men during pregnancy and the postpartum period . ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , can the prime minister confirm that the instruction has been given to federal employees to ignore these 200,000 applications being flagged as potentially fraudulent ? this is important . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , we have been focused entirely on getting help to canadians when they need it , and that has meant that yes , there will be things we will need to clean up after the fact and work to fix , but getting that help into canadians ' pockets during this pandemic was our priority . mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. chair , the prime minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage . we 're asking a very simple question here . will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud , the fraud will be pursued ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? right hon . justin trudeau : i know that the honourable member would n't want to inadvertently mislead the house . the fact is , the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources , hundreds of millions of dollars , to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities , including renting new spaces , to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19 . i recognize there 's always more to do , but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy , we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable canadians , and we will continue to do that . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : yes or no : did the canada revenue agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job , i 'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected ?

hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . mr. chris d'entremont : my next question is for the minister of health . mr. chair , on wednesday , february 26 , after the death of 23-year-old chantelle lindsay from nova scotia due to complications from cystic fibrosis , i asked the prime minister whether the government was going to make trikafta , which might have saved chantelle 's life , available to canadians . now that almost 12 weeks have passed , we understand that vertex pharmaceuticals has not yet applied to health canada for study . many of my conservative colleagues and i have recently sent a letter to the minister asking for an update on how we support those negotiations with vertex . can the minister of health tell us when this drug will be available to cf patients in canada ? hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . mr. simon-pierre savard-tremblay ( saint-hyacinthebagot , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . despite all the upheaval it causes , the crisis we are experiencing , considerable in scope though it is , can also be an opportunity to begin a transition . what is essential in normal times may , during a crisis , become crucial . what is unjust may , in times of crisis , become frankly scandalous . in quebec , we are generally allergic to blatant injustice and inequality . yesterday , ottawa announced new support for large companies . many of us in quebec feel that , when a company knocks on the state 's door to ask for assistance , it is totally legitimate for the state to impose conditions before providing its support . we in the bloc qubcois feel that there should be a limit , a ceiling , on the assistance provided to large companies , in order to avoid abuses in executive compensation . that is also the prevalent position in quebec . a few years ago , after the bombardier affair in quebeci will not dwell on that because quebecers are all too familiar with itthree of the four political parties that sat in the national assembly and that still sit these took a position of that kind . a number of civil society groups in quebec share it also . the united states , which , you will agree , is no bastion of socialism , has already implemented similar policies for periods of crisis . the idea is to offer support , but with conditions . according to a report published by the canadian centre for policy alternatives on january2 , the 100highest-paid ceos in canada earned 227times more in 2018 than the average worker . the average salary for workers increased by 2.6 % between 2017 and 2018. given that inflation was then at 2.3 % , it can be said that there was practically no increase . by contrast , the salary increase for ceos in the same period was 18 % , even in cases where the companies suffered losses . let us be clear that we were not in a crisis when that study was conducted . we can not even imagine what the figures are today . at this point , we are no longer talking about a gap but an abyss . wealth is concentrated at the top of the pyramid , but clearly does not flow down to the base . does the government intend to put a ceiling on executive compensation to ensure that they are not the only ones to profits from the support at this time of crisis ? the question is clear and i am asking you to give me a clear answer . if i do n't get one , i am going to have to demand a new version of the clarity act . hon . judy a. sgro ( humber riverblack creek , lib . ) : thank you very much , mr. chair . i appreciate the opportunity . i will be sharing my time with the member for kingshants . canadian seniors are worried about covid-19 . in my own riding of humber riverblack creek , 30 % of the population are 65 or older . we know they are one of the highest risk populations . during this time , their costs have gone up . they have had to spend extra on medication and grocery delivery , as many can not leave their homes . i have also heard of many seniors who are facing extra dispensing fees . these costs all add up , and many seniors were already carefully budgeting before the pandemic . it is so important that our government be there to support them . can the minister please tell us what our government is doing to ensure that vulnerable seniors get the support they need during this very difficult time ? hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . hon . navdeep bains ( minister of innovation , science and industry ) : mr. chair , my hon . colleague is absolutely right that the current situation with regard to the covid crisis is deeply problematic , and we want to make sure that any information we share with the canadian public with regard to economic measures or labour market numbers follows the appropriate process . the breach that occurred is completely unacceptable . our government has denounced this breach . that breach was not the way to deal with such sensitive information . the member has alluded to several paragraphs within the statistics act . i can assure him that we are looking into this matter and that statistics canada is looking into this issue as well . going forward , we will ensure that such a breach does not occur again , because it 's important that we continue to have the confidence of canadians during this current health care crisis . mr. ziad aboultaif : the minister indicated that this will be investigated , but during the investigation into the snc-lavalin scandal , the liberal staff refused to co-operate . will the minister commit today that all liberal staff will co-operate with this investigation ? mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and , in fact , municipal governments , which often run them and fund them partially as well . that 's why it 's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners , but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country , including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times , to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life , safety and dignity in their elder years . mr. chair , certainly the member of parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing . i do n't think that 's the case at all . as a matter of fact , what i hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how , first of all , we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? hon . jonathan wilkinson ( north vancouver , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . thank you very much for the question . certainly at this time , canadians are most particularly focused on ensuring that support is provided so that they can put food on the table and pay their rent . we are starting to focus on the relaxation measures in many provinces and territories in canada . that is the primary focus of the government , as it is of canadians . certainly as we move forward , we need to be thinking about the kind of society and economy that we want to create for the future . in that context , we need to learn lessons coming out of this experience , and certainly we need to ensure that we are addressing challenges that are on the horizon , including the challenge of climate change . those are conversations that will need to be had as we move beyond this phase of the crisis , but at the current time , the focus is clearly on combatting the virus . mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr.chair , since 2017 , our government has invested billions of dollars . i 'll answer the question in english . sorry . we launched our softwood lumber action plan to support workers in communities . we introduced funding through the strategic innovation fund specifically for forestry . building on our work today , we have included traditional investments to make sure this sector innovates , diversifies and grows . over these past two and a half months , i have spent an inordinate amount of time with ceos , with heads of the forestry sectors from coast to coast to coast . a few days ago , i convened a meeting of ceos from all parts of this country , from quebec to british columbia , to talk to them about solutions , about answers . the liquidity measures that were announced yesterday will help some of them . we will continue to work closely with industry to make sure we are there for them and that we stand by them through the covid crisis , so we make sure that hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , first of all , we share the member 's concern that small businesses be supported . that 's why we 've moved forward with a number of measures that are designed to be of assistance . with respect to rent support , we are encouraging landlords to support this measure . obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations are under provincial jurisdiction . at every opportunity i talk to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there . we will continue to support small businesses . we believe this program has significant merit . it allows for small businesses to significantly reduce their rent and for landlords to be protected with up to 75 % of the rent . we think it is an excellent program . it will require the provinces to step forward and enforce it . hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ? the chair : the minister had to repeat his answer . we 'll check and make sure it does n't happen again . the good thing is that this is all being filmed , so we can watch the video back to see what happened . </s>
<s> what did the canadian government do to help small businesses out ? </s> mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we are always looking for ways to reduce costs for consumers . we have worked with the big banks and the financial industry to ensure that people who need it have access to the help they need . we 're reassessing how we can lower costs for consumers . right now , we 're sending money to consumers across the country who need it to get through this crisis . that 's what we 'll continue to focus on . mr.chair , we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation . of course , there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well . ms. jenny kwan ( vancouver east , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . instead of providing a universal direct payment for all , the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind . a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to covid-19 . she pays taxes on her spousal income , but she is not eligible for cerb . the minister of employment said that she is looking into this gap . it has been weeks , and still no action . will the prime minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic ? right hon . justin trudeau : i know that the honourable member would n't want to inadvertently mislead the house . the fact is , the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources , hundreds of millions of dollars , to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities , including renting new spaces , to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19 . i recognize there 's always more to do , but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy , we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable canadians , and we will continue to do that . ms. jenny kwan : i would remind the prime minister that it was the federal liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993 , so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the liberals . we in vancouver east have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country , yet we got less than 2 % of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding . they 're overrepresented among the homeless population . why ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough ( minister of employment , workforce development and disability inclusion ) : mr. chair , i can clarify that service canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the cerb to the wage subsidy or from the cerb back to employment to ensure that there 's no overpayment , but of course that there 's no undue hardship on the individual . hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . mr. chair , i can assure all canadians that at the same time as employees have a right to refuse work and employers have an obligation to ensure healthy and safe workplaces , we want all people to be able to go back to work and feel safe . there are established processes and federal and provincial labour processes for refusal to work , and at the end of the day the cerb is there for workers who are n't working due to covid-19 . mrs. stephanie kusie : nearly two months into living in some form of isolation , watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the covid-19 pandemic , eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $ 500 . why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else ? hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. brian masse : apparently , we 're meeting for nothing . i 'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing canadians during this public crisis . credit card interest rates are still high from previous price-gouging levels . despite numerous favours from the liberals , there have not been significant changes . vancity savings credit union demonstrated leadership when it set credit card rates at zero . will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that vancity has already done ? hon . bill morneau : as i 've said , mr. chair , we 're continuing to support consumers . we 're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers , and we 've seen actions in this regard , supporting customers . mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr. brian masse : will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than vancity 's ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , again , we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they 're supporting their customers . what banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction . mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? mr.chair , when it comes to the covid-19 crisis , what canadians will remember is that those with access to reliable high-speed internet will have fared better , feeling less financial strain , than those who are cut off from the rest of the world . is the government ready to invest in making high-speed internet available to all canadians , no matter where they live in the country ? mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : respectfully to the minister , you 're letting down canadians . people are being stranded , and you need to do better as a government . changing gears a little , all canadians would agree , or can agree , that the prime minister requires suitable accommodation . why did the government simply not tell canadians that the harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded ? mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? ms. elizabeth may : as a follow-up to the minister 's comment , i note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in winnipeg on an ebola vaccine . because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product , it is alleged that the ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model . i wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs . is that a conversation the minister is having with others ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ?

hon . steven guilbeault : i hope the member is n't suggesting that , because some members of the house are making an effort to speak french , they are unduly dragging out the time , as he seems to have said . good for them , i say , for trying to speak a language they are n't necessarily comfortable in for the benefit of other members . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about things including fishing and tourism , oil and gas affected by the covid-19 . </s> ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ?

mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough ( minister of employment , workforce development and disability inclusion ) : mr. chair , i can clarify that service canada will work closely with anybody who transitions either from the cerb to the wage subsidy or from the cerb back to employment to ensure that there 's no overpayment , but of course that there 's no undue hardship on the individual . hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . hon . mlanie joly ( minister of economic development and official languages ) : i have had the opportunity to speak to my colleague mr.d'entremont about solutions to assist people in the tourism sector all over the country , and particularly in the atlantic region . in light of the new funding for the atlantic canada opportunities agency , acoa , i will be happy to work with him and with the leaders of the tourism sector . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . let me just emphasize to the honourable member that on a couple of occasions he has implied that a loosening of the current restrictions is being discussed . let me be very clear that this is his assertion ; i have not said that . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . bill morneau : as i 've said , mr. chair , we 're continuing to support consumers . we 're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers , and we 've seen actions in this regard , supporting customers . mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr. chair , again , we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they 're supporting their customers . what banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction . mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? hon . bill morneau : mr.chair , we are continuing to work towards that end . it is always very important to protect canadians , and we are going to stick to that approach . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i 'd like to thank the member for his question . i fully understand , as we all do , the important role processors play in our system and our country . i can assure the members of the house that we will continue to work with canadian processors as the agreement comes into force . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the current economic situation could lead to the disappearance of canada 's tourism industry . the pain will be felt by thousands of canadians , who will have to find new jobs in order to survive . is the government going to protect the tourism-based economy by investing in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure canada 's tourist regions are ready when the economy reopens ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . mr. corey tochor : respectfully to the minister , you 're letting down canadians . people are being stranded , and you need to do better as a government . changing gears a little , all canadians would agree , or can agree , that the prime minister requires suitable accommodation . why did the government simply not tell canadians that the harrington cottage needed to be rebuilt and massively expanded ? hon . anita anand : the ncc is an independent crown corporation . it recognizes the importance of the official residences it has jurisdiction over . the work at harrington lake is part of a broader program to preserve and maintain and restore all official residences under ncc management , and we will support the ncc in its important work . mr. corey tochor : respectfully , canadians feel misled on this , and we 're not clear on what the expenses were , how large an expansion it was the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . navdeep bains : as i have indicated very clearly , what has happened is completely unacceptable . this breach should not have occurred . this matter is being looked into , and we want to assure canadians going forward that mr. ziad aboultaif : in that case , the minister said the matter will be looked into . basically , my understanding of this case is that statistics canada is going to investigate itself , or does the minister think that the government should refer this to the rcmp ? mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? mr. chair , the government 's assistance package for the canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry . the lack of detail and action has led to some challenges . can the minister clarify ? on a medium-sized energy company 's eligibility , if the company is in default to financial institutions , does it still qualify for the business credit availability program ? hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? mr. mario simard ( jonquire , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . a few weeks ago , the prime minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy . ministerguilbeault , ministermckenna and ministerwilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that . today , i worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell , a convenient post-crisis political pitch . on the natural resources front , the government 's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels . we need only think of the $ 1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells . perhaps there is an environmental component , but i 'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday 's announcement by export and development canada . it 's going to lend tc energy $ 500million to build its coastal gaslink pipeline . that 's $ 500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually . how does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy ? mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ? </s>
<s> what did the government do to help the fishing industry ? </s> mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. chair , the prime minister can leave the cottage talk for the cottage . we 're asking a very simple question here . will he commit as a government to enforce the rule of law and to enforce the attestation that says that if someone commits fraud , the fraud will be pursued ? that 's not what i 'm asking here , mr. chair . the conservatives supported the legislation that allowed those supports to go through . what we are asking about is fraud . all along we 've been told fraud would be detected through audits after the fact , and we expect that to happen . can the prime minister at least confirm that this will happen ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis . we do n't expect the big banks to need these funds . before we provide any money , we 're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed , including internationally . mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , i 'll change the subject now . consumers are paying more and more with their credit cards , which allows contactless payments in shops , not to mention online shopping . this benefits visa and mastercard , which charge appallingly high user fees , known as interchange fees . these are almost 10times higher than in europe and australia , and it costs our merchants a fortune . can the prime minister follow the example of europe and australia by capping interchange fees at0.3 % ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation . of course , there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well . ms. jenny kwan ( vancouver east , ndp ) : thank you , mr. chair . instead of providing a universal direct payment for all , the government has decided to implement a complicated program that leaves many people behind . a single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to covid-19 . she pays taxes on her spousal income , but she is not eligible for cerb . the minister of employment said that she is looking into this gap . it has been weeks , and still no action . will the prime minister step in and fix this gap so that the single parents and their children can get the support they need during this pandemic ? right hon . justin trudeau : i know that the honourable member would n't want to inadvertently mislead the house . the fact is , the federal government almost immediately sent significant resources , hundreds of millions of dollars , to shelters across the country to enable them to create facilities , including renting new spaces , to be able to house homeless people without increasing the danger of the spread of covid-19 . i recognize there 's always more to do , but as we demonstrated with our national housing strategy , we are serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable canadians , and we will continue to do that . ms. jenny kwan : i would remind the prime minister that it was the federal liberals who eliminated the national affordable housing program in 1993 , so we have this homeless crisis today as a result of the liberals . we in vancouver east have the third-largest urban indigenous population in the country , yet we got less than 2 % of the pandemic urban indigenous housing funding . they 're overrepresented among the homeless population . why ? hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ?

will you use your statutory powers , yes or no , to do what vancity has done to help canadian consumers ? hon . bill morneau : as i 've said , mr. chair , we 're continuing to support consumers . we 're continuing to work together with banks to make sure that they are giving the kind of support necessary to their customers , and we 've seen actions in this regard , supporting customers . mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr. brian masse : will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than vancity 's ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , again , we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they 're supporting their customers . what banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction . mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ?

ms. elizabeth may : as a follow-up to the minister 's comment , i note it was interesting to see the claim made by this public health institute at dalhousie about the wonderful research that was being done in winnipeg on an ebola vaccine . because of the for-profit motive and the interests that big pharma had in seeing their market before they developed the product , it is alleged that the ebola vaccine was actually delayed by the for-profit model . i wonder if we might consider examining this profit motive around the development of life-saving vaccines and other drugs . is that a conversation the minister is having with others ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , if we treated children the way we do seniors in this country , social services would seize them . over 80 % of the deaths in canada from covid-19 have occurred in long-term care homes . canada has the highest proportion of deaths in long-term care home settings among 14 comparable countries , including france , germany , denmark and ireland . canadians want action . what specifically is the minister going to do about the crisis in long-term care ? hon . patty hajdu : mr. chair , the member opposite knows that long-term care homes have rested largely in the jurisdiction of provincial governments and , in fact , municipal governments , which often run them and fund them partially as well . that 's why it 's important that we have those conversations with our provincial and territorial partners , but the member can rest assured that it is on the top of my priority list to engage with my colleagues all across the country , including many experts who have studied this issue multiple times , to come up with stronger standards so all seniors have quality of life , safety and dignity in their elder years . mr. chair , certainly the member of parliament has made an assertion that there is finger pointing . i do n't think that 's the case at all . as a matter of fact , what i hear from my colleagues at the provincial and territorial level is the willingness to collaborate on how , first of all , we get through this crisis together and strengthen safety for seniors in homes right now and then how we look to the future to build a stronger network of long-term care or care alternatives that will ensure that seniors have the right and the ability to live with dignity and safety in their homes . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ?

will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . mr. marc dalton : mr. chair , according to the cerb website , if a recipient earns over $ 1,000 in a reporting period , their entire $ 2,000 benefit must be repaid . i have constituents who are working part time and casually . they 're worried that if they take an extra shift , they will lose their cerb , but if they refuse a shift , they will also lose their cerb . it 's a classic liberal catch-22 . a worker may unknowingly make over the $ 1,000 by a couple of dollars . does the government intend to make them repay all their cerb if they barely go over the threshold ?

<s> what did the stress faced by oil and gas ? </s> ms. yasmin ratansi ( don valley east , lib . ) : thank you , mr. chair . i have the pleasure of presenting a petition on behalf of my constituents of don valley east . the petitioners are asking that the government of canada not provide any financial assistance to canadian airlines until they promptly provide full refunds for flights that were cancelled due to covid-19 . they are asking the same for any foreign airlines that fly to , within or from canada . the petitioners feel that these canadians are facing economic hardship and need a refund . right hon . justin trudeau : mr. chair , my office and i have been absolutely focused on getting the necessary help to canadians . perhaps , as mr. albas points out , other parties would have been slower to get the money out . we were flowing money to people who needed it . mr. dan albas : mr. chair , the question was quite simple . obviously the prime minister does n't seem comfortable with the answer . will he at least then commit to investigating every individual case of fraud , or will he write them off , as the story said ? mr. gabriel ste-marie : mr.chair , sometimes a bank will relocate its most profitable activities carried out in canada and register them in a subsidiary in the bahamas , barbados or another tax haven . does the prime minister consider this bank to be paying its fair share of taxes in canada ? right hon . justin trudeau : mr.chair , we will assess applications for the large employer emergency funding facility on a case-by-case basis . we do n't expect the big banks to need these funds . before we provide any money , we 're going to make sure that whoever wants to access these funds is transparent about how the money is being managed , including internationally . mr.chair , we continue to work with financial institutions and the big banks to help consumers during this exceptional and difficult situation . of course , there are some things we can look at over the longer term as well . the chair : the honourable minister . hon . ahmed hussen ( minister of families , children and social development ) : mr. chair , i want to assure the honourable member that we are doing everything that we can in service canada to meet the expectations of canadians . in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , we have had unprecedented volumes , but we have redeployed thousands of staff to front-line services by phone and by other means . we had to close a number of the centres because of covid-19 concerns and the safety and well-being of canadians . the chair : the honourable minister . mr. alain rayes ( richmondarthabaska , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . my question is for the prime minister . is it true that canada revenue agency employees who process applications for the canada emergency response benefit , or cerb , have been asked to send the payment even if fraud had been detected , as was pointed out in a national media report today ? hon . diane lebouthillier ( minister of national revenue ) : mr.chair , our government considers these to be very difficult times for canadians . we 're going to do everything we can to support them by helping them pay for their housing and their groceries . i 'm very proud of the public servants who work at the canada revenue agency . nearly sevenmillion mr. alain rayes : yes or no : did the canada revenue agency send a memo to its employeeswho are doing an exceptional job , i 'd like to point outso that they would ignore the 200,000potential cases of fraud that they detected ? mr.chair , the extremely simple question i am asking the minister comes from companies and workers . none of the officials dares to answer it when we call on technical matters , even though they are supposed to give us information that we can pass on to the public with complete transparency . so let me repeat my question ; i do n't think there can be a simpler one . the answer will benefit the workers and the companies that want access to the canada emergency wage subsidy . if an employee is called back to workwhich is perfectly fineagrees to do so and wants to reimburse the cerb , must he reimburse $ 500for each week he works during the month , or the entire $ 2,000 ? hon . carla qualtrough : mr. chair , that will depend on the individual circumstances of the particular worker . that 's why service canada is reaching out to individuals to make it as seamless as possible for them . i can assure the member that nobody will be put in a difficult situation . i recognize that there is some uncertainty , but we 're trying to address that . thank you . the chair : mr.rayes , you have 35seconds left . the honourable minister . the honourable minister . mrs. stephanie kusie : nearly two months into living in some form of isolation , watching their retirement savings take a hit and having to take additional health precautions due to the covid-19 pandemic , eligible seniors are set to receive a one-time payment of up to $ 500 . why does this government consistently undervalue seniors compared with everyone else ? the chair : the honourable minister . hon . chrystia freeland : i 'm not sure what the member is alluding to , but let me just say that the current arrangements are working extremely well . non-essential travel is down very sharply . essential travel , particularly for trade , continues , and that 's a good thing , too . mr. brian masse : apparently , we 're meeting for nothing . i 'll move to the large commercial banks who are profiteering off or squeezing canadians during this public crisis . credit card interest rates are still high from previous price-gouging levels . despite numerous favours from the liberals , there have not been significant changes . vancity savings credit union demonstrated leadership when it set credit card rates at zero . will the government use its statutory powers and force the banks to offer the credit card relief that vancity has already done ? the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , i think it 's important to clarify that banks have come forward and given deferrals to customers in trouble and cut their interest by half mr. brian masse : not on credit cards . hon . bill morneau : and that 's been important on credit cards . mr. brian masse : will the minister use his powers if the banks continue to charge canadian consumers interest rates that are higher than vancity 's ? hon . bill morneau : mr. chair , again , we will continue to work with banks to ensure that they 're supporting their customers . what banks have done on credit cards by cutting their fees in half is an important nod in that direction . mr. jacques gourde ( lvislotbinire , cpc ) : thank you , mr.chair . quebec is canada 's biggest producer of hydroelectricity , a renewable energy that is the pride of the quebec nation . the only problem is that it seems to be a tough sell west of quebec , in ontario , for instance . this competitively priced power could help us reduce our environmental footprint and further cut greenhouse gas emissions . will the government show leadership and allow canada 's provinces to share renewable energy through an energy corridor , as we proposed ? mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , canada 's dairy processors have been hit hard by the covid-19 crisis and the new canadau.s.mexico agreement , or cusma . some of them have incurred losses ranging from 10 % to 50 % , depending on the processed product . will the government commit to granting import permits under cusma to canada 's dairy processors , not retailers directly ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i can assure you that dairy producers will receive fair compensation . i should also point out that we preserved supply management when negotiating the new nafta . that is important to canada and quebec , and i 'm very pleased that we were able to do that . mr. jacques gourde : mr.chair , the minister seems to be missing the issue in hand . canada 's dairy processors invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to bring high-quality products to consumers , while contributing $ 19billion to gdp . now those very processors are being asked to try to export canadian value-added products . will the minister commit to giving canada 's dairy processors import permits , instead of encouraging american multinationals ? hon . chrystia freeland : mr.chair , i 'd like to thank the member for his question . i fully understand , as we all do , the important role processors play in our system and our country . i can assure the members of the house that we will continue to work with canadian processors as the agreement comes into force . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . hon . bill blair : the cbsa has exercised the appropriate discretion in determining when a non-canadian citizen , who has no status in canada , attempts to enter the country for any consideration considered non-essential . they are turned back because we have restrictions in place for non-essential travel . the acting chair ( mr. bruce stanton ) : the honourable minister . the honourable minister . the honourable minister . mr. david yurdiga ( fort mcmurraycold lake , cpc ) : thank you , mr. chair . before i start my questions , i would like to thank the various ministers , parliamentary secretaries and the speaker of the house for reaching out to me during the severe flooding in fort mcmurray . your support during these trying times is much appreciated . the oil and gas industry is under severe strain . over the past number of years , we have seen tremendous pressure on the federal government from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . the federal liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , bill c-69 , which will prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in canada ; and the oil shipping ban , bill c-48 , for the northern coast of british columbia , which also had a negative effect on the oil industry . these two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of canada , causing the alberta economy to retract to recession levels . to compound alberta 's economic problems , we have an international oil price war and the covid-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . mr. chair , 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there are still no applications open for these loans . can the honourable minister of natural resources tell us when the liberals will act on their promise ? hon . seamus o'regan : mr. chair , canada 's oil sector provides jobs for more than 576,000 people , including 11,000 indigenous people , in every part of canada . it is essential that we support those businesses . it is essential that we support the many indigenous people who work in our oil and gas sector , particularly in alberta and saskatchewan . we have provided supports for those businesses , and we will continue to do so , also keeping in mind that in many of these communities the importance of public health and safety is foremost in our minds . mr. david yurdiga : mr. chair , western canada oil storage is under extreme pressure . if thermal projects such as sagd are shut down , those facilities could be lost forever . if the global oil markets remain oversupplied into the summer and industry must shut down production , what is the government 's plan to ensure canada 's energy security and the economic future of the oil sands with the potential shutdown of oil production ? mr. chair , the government 's assistance package for the canadian oil and gas industry provides some hope to the industry . the lack of detail and action has led to some challenges . can the minister clarify ? on a medium-sized energy company 's eligibility , if the company is in default to financial institutions , does it still qualify for the business credit availability program ? hon . bill blair : i want to thank the member for the question . i want to assure her that at the first opportunity , we will bring forward legislation dealing with a number of aspects of our commitment to strengthen gun control in canada , including legislation to deal with a buyback program , which we 've indicated we will put in place . there are a number of other significant measures as well that we intend to bring forward to strengthen gun control legislation . we understand that it 's a priority . the pandemic does not diminish our responsibility to do what is necessary to keep canadians safe , and we will bring that legislation forward at the first opportunity . hon . patty hajdu : i offer my gratitude to the many people who are working in these long-term care facilities day and night to keep seniors safe . the member certainly highlighted that there are not only additional expenses for some of the not-for-profit seniors homes , but also additional new measures that will increase all kinds of things , including costs . we continue to work with the provinces and territories and support them through , for example , generous transfers of money to boost their health care systems in ways that they think are most appropriate . we continue to have conversations at the health ministers ' table on how we can support them . mr. don davies : mr. chair , what i 'm not hearing is a single concrete proposal or measure that this minister is suggesting her government can take , but let me move to another subject . like long-term care , covid-19 has exposed other major gaps in our health care system . millions of canadians lost their prescription benefits when they lost their jobs , revealing the fundamental weakness of medical coverage tied to employment status . will this government finally move to ensure all canadians get the medicine they need by bringing in universal pharmacare at the earliest opportunity ? mr. mario simard ( jonquire , bq ) : thank you , mr.chair . a few weeks ago , the prime minister made a big announcement expressing his desire to launch an economic recovery plan that fast-tracks the transition to a green economy . ministerguilbeault , ministermckenna and ministerwilkinson were appointed to a group tasked with doing just that . today , i worry that the group is nothing but an empty shell , a convenient post-crisis political pitch . on the natural resources front , the government 's two main announcements primarily involve fossil fuels . we need only think of the $ 1.7billion being invested to clean up orphan wells . perhaps there is an environmental component , but i 'm having trouble wrapping my head around yesterday 's announcement by export and development canada . it 's going to lend tc energy $ 500million to build its coastal gaslink pipeline . that 's $ 500million for a pipeline project that will eventually produce 8.6million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually . how does the government reconcile that with its desire to transition to a green economy ? mr. mario simard : thank you , mr.chair . i want to tell you that , of all industries , the one best positioned to make the energy transition is probably the forestry industry . unfortunately , in canadaa petro statethere always seem to be two sets of rules when it comes to helping key industries , including providing liquidity support . yesterday 's announcement suggests that the $ 500million being provided by edc is for a single project : coastal gaslink . in 2017 , under the softwood lumber action plan , edc 's entire budget for the forestry industry was exactly $ 500million . now , edc is shelling out $ 500million for just one project , coastal gaslink , even though the whole of the forestry industry also received $ 500million when it needed edc 's support under a 2017 action plan to deal with tariffs . the industry accounts for 58,000jobs in quebec and $ 6billion of quebec 's gdp . as i see it , there is a fundamental inequity . my question is for the natural resources minister . does he think this situation is fair ? will he commit to providing the forestry industry with the same amount of liquidity being made available to the fossil fuel sector ? hon . anita anand : mr. chair , as a federal government , we are aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies . our first priority is to provide ppe to our front-line health care workers . however , we are actively involved in trying to ascertain how the federal government can work with the provinces and territories to provide essential services and other businesses with ppe . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> dawn bowden am : i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? barry hughes : iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis . i met with a minister and a deputy minister—i met with huw irranca-davies a little while ago , and i met with julie morgan a few months ago—to discuss the overall implications , and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other . it has n't been a very close-knit involvement , but we have had enough involvement so that we 've felt we 've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation . they would need to be aware , but not to the same extent . we have regular interchange of prosecutors between england and wales . so , in my office in cardiff , for example , because we work digitally , i have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the cps in london , and they work exclusively on london cases . but there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in wales , and then there may be an interchange ; they 'll come to work for us on secondment , or they 'll come to work for us permanently . we 'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of welsh law that diverge from english law . suzy davies am : thank you . i was going to ask this question later , but i think it fits in— . i 've forgotten what i was going to ask ; this is terrible . oh no , that 's right—obviously , this act is on a particular trajectory at the moment , and it 's due to be introduced before the end of this assembly . do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this act if we could see the draft changes to cps guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision ? sian gwenllian am : my point is about the criminal law in wales and england diverging in this particular instance , and we 've been told that this is probably the first time it 's happened . can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion ? do you think that what we 're doing in wales will be emulated in england at some point ? barry hughes : well , it 's certainly going through in parallel in scotland , and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this , including a large number of european countries . who knows ? trying to get any legislation through westminster at the moment—who knows ? not tomorrow , i 'd say . suzy davies am : perhaps you can run us through it quickly . barry hughes : if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . and we 've got to disprove that to the criminal standard , which is beyond a reasonable doubt . so , you can certainly see— . i can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter , to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial , and it would be our responsibility to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? barry hughes : from the perspective of the cps , i 'm not sure i can help you there . suzy davies am : thank you for that , because i thought that was important to get on the record as well . we 're looking at a period of a couple of years after this act passes—if it does—for implementation . is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law ? barry hughes : i think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we 've built up with the welsh government and colleagues there . i think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward . we need involvement—iwan , for example , and the strategic implementation group . we have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that , and i believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected ; that we can liaise , in turn , with kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop . so , i think we 've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose—at least , 'adequate ' might sound a little— suzy davies am : sufficient . yes . okay , that 's great . bear with me a second—thank you very much—in your written evidence , you did welcome the indication from the welsh government that this reasonable period after royal assent would be necessary . apart from the cps guideline changes , which you 'll be working through , is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch ? i 'm just thinking : are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this ? barry hughes : i have to say i think that extremely unlikely . in the cps , we do n't have targets for securing convictions or not . clearly , we prosecute if we think that there 's a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but we have no targets . and i would also say , because the numbers here are likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets—it 's a tiny , tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean . sian gwenllian am : are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : no , i think we 've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen . and i ca n't think of anything else off the top of my head . right . how to approach that one ? in the 2007 review to which we 've referred already , the government , the then government , set out its position that it believes that section 58 , in the way that it was drafted , is compliant with the european convention . there are various parties who would disagree with that , but that was the then government 's position . if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law , then , arguably , wales would be more in compliance with echr than not , and england would be less so . but nonetheless , at present , i have n't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007 , which is that they consider that the position that 's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation . it may well be tested by case law ; that 's the way it 's likely to happen . some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so , that case i referred to , regina v h , which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal , was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about the efficacy of the law . </s> sian gwenllian am : but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? barry hughes : if this bill goes through , then it will remove a defence , which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand , but it does n't necessarily mean they will refer it , because it will depend on the facts of each individual case . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . hello . the assembly does n't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the cps , as you know , in the absence of the secretary of state 's consent . what are the implications for implementing the bill in wales for that ? i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? barry hughes : iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis . i met with a minister and a deputy minister—i met with huw irranca-davies a little while ago , and i met with julie morgan a few months ago—to discuss the overall implications , and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other . it has n't been a very close-knit involvement , but we have had enough involvement so that we 've felt we 've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation . yes . i do n't feel that it 's been too much , nor do i feel we 've been left on the side at all . they would need to be aware , but not to the same extent . we have regular interchange of prosecutors between england and wales . so , in my office in cardiff , for example , because we work digitally , i have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the cps in london , and they work exclusively on london cases . but there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in wales , and then there may be an interchange ; they 'll come to work for us on secondment , or they 'll come to work for us permanently . we 'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of welsh law that diverge from english law . dawn bowden am : that 's helpful , thank you . my final question , chair , is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation . suzy davies am : thank you . i was going to ask this question later , but i think it fits in— . i 've forgotten what i was going to ask ; this is terrible . oh no , that 's right—obviously , this act is on a particular trajectory at the moment , and it 's due to be introduced before the end of this assembly . do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this act if we could see the draft changes to cps guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision ?

<s> what did barry hughes think about the legal framework when talking about the efficacy of the law ? </s> barry hughes : shall i address that in terms— ? okay . so , you are probably aware , but forgive me if i just explain quickly anyway , when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for crown prosecutors , which has a two-stage test . the first stage is whether there 's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second stage is— . and you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied . if there is n't enough evidence , we do n't go on to consider whether it 's in the public interest , because we would n't put an offence before the courts if we did n't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction . so , we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied . so , to return to the point , if we have an offence where , let 's say , there is a light smack at the time , the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us . we do n't always agree with the police ; generally we do , but we do n't always agree . it 's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the crown prosecution service . so , if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it 's unlikely that would come to the cps , because they would look at it and say , 'reasonable chastisement provides for a defence . ' if that defence is removed , then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the cps . i would like to think—and i think this is what will probably happen in practice—that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed , but it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . it may be that the police decide that it is—it may have been two smacks , three smacks , so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious . so , it may be referred to the cps for a charging decision . we would then apply independently the same test , and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists , which takes us on to considering the public interest . in the circumstances that i 've described , every case is going to be unique on its own facts , but in the circumstances that i 've described , if it is just a light smack and it 's a one-off and there 's no history of this , it would probably be the sort of offence we 'd decide it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . sian gwenllian am : but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? dawn bowden am : i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? barry hughes : iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis . i met with a minister and a deputy minister—i met with huw irranca-davies a little while ago , and i met with julie morgan a few months ago—to discuss the overall implications , and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other . it has n't been a very close-knit involvement , but we have had enough involvement so that we 've felt we 've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation . they would need to be aware , but not to the same extent . we have regular interchange of prosecutors between england and wales . so , in my office in cardiff , for example , because we work digitally , i have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the cps in london , and they work exclusively on london cases . but there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in wales , and then there may be an interchange ; they 'll come to work for us on secondment , or they 'll come to work for us permanently . we 'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of welsh law that diverge from english law . dawn bowden am : that 's helpful , thank you . my final question , chair , is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation . barry hughes : if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? barry hughes : simply because that 's a matter for the police . unlike in many other jurisdictions , we have no power whatsoever to direct the police , so if the police decide not to investigate— . i routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something , and they want us to do something about it and we ca n't . we ca n't direct the police . suzy davies am : thank you for that , because i thought that was important to get on the record as well . we 're looking at a period of a couple of years after this act passes—if it does—for implementation . is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law ?

i 'm not offering any views on the fact that this choice has been given , but it was put to us today about how would that fall in the law once it were changed . barry hughes : that 's a really interesting question . there is a body of law that— i 'm not sure it 's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not . i can , however , say that i think the greater the level of awareness , the more likely it is that the act , if passed , will achieve its intentions . sian gwenllian am : what about— ? there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : right . how to approach that one ? in the 2007 review to which we 've referred already , the government , the then government , set out its position that it believes that section 58 , in the way that it was drafted , is compliant with the european convention . there are various parties who would disagree with that , but that was the then government 's position . if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law , then , arguably , wales would be more in compliance with echr than not , and england would be less so . but nonetheless , at present , i have n't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007 , which is that they consider that the position that 's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation . it may well be tested by case law ; that 's the way it 's likely to happen . some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so , that case i referred to , regina v h , which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal , was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>
<s> what was the two-stage test during prosecutions when discussing the efficacy of the law ? </s> barry hughes : if you take an example—so , one of the examples that i 've heard discussed has been a child—a young child ; let 's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road—who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic . the parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back . now , technically , taking hold of the child at that point is an assault , because it 's an unwanted imposition of physical force . but no-one 's going to say that 's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts . of course , that would be utter nonsense . there 's no hostility ; it 's simply taking hold of a child to protect them . at that point , the parent then seeks to admonish the child , tells them off and smacks the child on the legs . now , that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement . probably . but so much depends upon the circumstances , whether this is something that happens frequently with the child , the size of the child , the parent , the force of the slap , the way in which it 's imposed . so , that , i would say , sits at one end of the spectrum . as we move towards the other end of the spectrum , we might have repeated smacking , shouting , maybe hitting the child over the head as well . so , there is a spectrum of offending . towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature . there 'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police , and the police would take some form of action , and then , as we move through the tiers , it 'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the crown prosecution service for a charging decision . we would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it . and the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it 's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court . that would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that i 've just described to you . does that help to illustrate that , at one end , it 's relatively white and the other end it 's relatively black , but in the middle we have the shades of grey ? sian gwenllian am : but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? dawn bowden am : i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? sian gwenllian am : do you think that what we 're doing in wales will be emulated in england at some point ? barry hughes : if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . and we 've got to disprove that to the criminal standard , which is beyond a reasonable doubt . so , you can certainly see— . i can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter , to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial , and it would be our responsibility to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ?

this is one , which—i give credit to iwan for this , because he thought of it . if we take an adult with a small child—say , a four-year-old—in a supermarket , and the child is pulling cans off the shelves , it 's quite annoying , and they keep doing it and keep doing it . the parent remonstrates , and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate , and smacks the child lightly on the legs , which does the trick and the child stops . presently , if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police , i think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement . in other words , the evidential stage would n't be passed ; you do n't get on to consider the public interest . but if we have that same parent in there the following week , and you have the same happen again , presently , the defence would apply . now , there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying . if that defence did n't apply at all , and we had a sequence of three offences , the public interest test would kick in , if i may put it like that , pretty quickly , because it would be repeated behaviour . so , that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future , because the defence would not be available , so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly . so , when we apply the public interest test , the essence of it is about proportionality , and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending . we look at the age of the offender , the age of the victim , we look at the circumstances , we look at the impact upon the victim , we look at the impact that 's likely in relation to the suspect , and there is , within the code , a long list of matters that we take into account . some of them are fairly obvious , such as previous convictions . if someone 's got previous convictions for doing something wrong , it 's more likely they 're going to be prosecuted the next time . but there 's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow . mostly , it 's reasonably obvious ; the more serious an offence , the more likely you are to be prosecuted . normally , if there were an assault by someone else upon a child , outside the family , we would tend to take views from the parents of that child . in circumstances where both parents , arguably , are the suspects , we probably would n't be asking them . we would find another way , and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened . it may be that there are— . i can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used , effectively , in divorce proceedings , for example , where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there was n't . we 'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that . so , we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it . it 's not determinative , nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims . it 's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account . that 's a really interesting question . there is a body of law that— i 'm not sure it 's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not . i can , however , say that i think the greater the level of awareness , the more likely it is that the act , if passed , will achieve its intentions . sian gwenllian am : what about— ? there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? barry hughes : there is greater potential for it to increase . i think the numbers , again , will be tiny , and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners—whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses . regrettably , there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute . getting into the subtleties of the father , say , smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here . i can see it potentially arising . it 's not something that would cause me concern , simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce , sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication . sian gwenllian am : are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : right . how to approach that one ? in the 2007 review to which we 've referred already , the government , the then government , set out its position that it believes that section 58 , in the way that it was drafted , is compliant with the european convention . there are various parties who would disagree with that , but that was the then government 's position . if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law , then , arguably , wales would be more in compliance with echr than not , and england would be less so . but nonetheless , at present , i have n't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007 , which is that they consider that the position that 's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation . it may well be tested by case law ; that 's the way it 's likely to happen . some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so , that case i referred to , regina v h , which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal , was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about the divergence between the law in england and wales . </s> sian gwenllian am : what are the areas of grey that you refer to ? can you give a few examples ? but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? barry hughes : if this bill goes through , then it will remove a defence , which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand , but it does n't necessarily mean they will refer it , because it will depend on the facts of each individual case . lynne neagle am : we 've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in england and wales from dawn bowden . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . hello . the assembly does n't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the cps , as you know , in the absence of the secretary of state 's consent . what are the implications for implementing the bill in wales for that ? i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? barry hughes : iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on a more routine basis . i met with a minister and a deputy minister—i met with huw irranca-davies a little while ago , and i met with julie morgan a few months ago—to discuss the overall implications , and then officials on both sides have been engaging with each other . it has n't been a very close-knit involvement , but we have had enough involvement so that we 've felt we 've been able to offer views on how we would deal with the legislation . dawn bowden am : and are you satisfied that your staff in wales—well , and in england , actually , across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law ? barry hughes : they would need to be aware , but not to the same extent . we have regular interchange of prosecutors between england and wales . so , in my office in cardiff , for example , because we work digitally , i have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the cps in london , and they work exclusively on london cases . but there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in wales , and then there may be an interchange ; they 'll come to work for us on secondment , or they 'll come to work for us permanently . we 'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of welsh law that diverge from english law . dawn bowden am : that 's helpful , thank you . my final question , chair , is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation . suzy davies am : thank you . i was going to ask this question later , but i think it fits in— . i 've forgotten what i was going to ask ; this is terrible . oh no , that 's right—obviously , this act is on a particular trajectory at the moment , and it 's due to be introduced before the end of this assembly . do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this act if we could see the draft changes to cps guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision ? sian gwenllian am : my point is about the criminal law in wales and england diverging in this particular instance , and we 've been told that this is probably the first time it 's happened . can you think of any other examples where that divergence has happened and does it actually set some kind of precedent in motion ? suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? barry hughes : simply because that 's a matter for the police . unlike in many other jurisdictions , we have no power whatsoever to direct the police , so if the police decide not to investigate— . i routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something , and they want us to do something about it and we ca n't . we ca n't direct the police . suzy davies am : thank you for that , because i thought that was important to get on the record as well . we 're looking at a period of a couple of years after this act passes—if it does—for implementation . is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law ? so , you 're confident , by 2022 , then , that you 'll have changes to the cps guidelines that are good to go , if you like . barry hughes : i can attempt an answer . i follow entirely where you 're going . i agree , the chances are pretty low , but they 're greater than they are presently . in other words , there is a greater degree of protection for children , and i think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out . i go back to what i was saying to you right at the start , about the evolution of the law , and the way we 've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the welsh government is , in my view , an evolution of the law . so , yes , there may not be many more prosecutions , but there wo n't be fewer than there are presently , because there 's a greater degree of protection for children . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . and , in your written evidence , you mentioned the fact that there 's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in england and that if a person from england is being prosecuted in wales as a result of this change , a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in wales . can i ask what approach the cps currently takes in wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who 's come from outside the uk , for example ? okay , thank you . we 've got some questions now on the unintended consequences from siân gwenllian . sian gwenllian am : what about— ? there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? </s>
<s> what did barry hughes think about the implications for implementing the bill in wales when talking about the divergence between the law in england and wales ? </s> sian gwenllian am : well , a review was undertaken by the government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form—that that would be the best thing to do because there 's no evidence that it 's not working satisfactorily . you are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that 's happened since 2007. but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? barry hughes : if this bill goes through , then it will remove a defence , which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand , but it does n't necessarily mean they will refer it , because it will depend on the facts of each individual case . dawn bowden am : i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ?

there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : right . how to approach that one ? in the 2007 review to which we 've referred already , the government , the then government , set out its position that it believes that section 58 , in the way that it was drafted , is compliant with the european convention . there are various parties who would disagree with that , but that was the then government 's position . if wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law , then , arguably , wales would be more in compliance with echr than not , and england would be less so . but nonetheless , at present , i have n't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007 , which is that they consider that the position that 's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation . it may well be tested by case law ; that 's the way it 's likely to happen . some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so , that case i referred to , regina v h , which was heard back in 2001 in the court of appeal , was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58. there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>

<s> summarize the discussion about out-of-court disposals . </s> barry hughes : shall i address that in terms— ? okay . so , you are probably aware , but forgive me if i just explain quickly anyway , when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for crown prosecutors , which has a two-stage test . the first stage is whether there 's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second stage is— . and you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied . if there is n't enough evidence , we do n't go on to consider whether it 's in the public interest , because we would n't put an offence before the courts if we did n't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction . so , we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied . so , to return to the point , if we have an offence where , let 's say , there is a light smack at the time , the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us . we do n't always agree with the police ; generally we do , but we do n't always agree . it 's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the crown prosecution service . so , if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it 's unlikely that would come to the cps , because they would look at it and say , 'reasonable chastisement provides for a defence . ' if that defence is removed , then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the cps . i would like to think—and i think this is what will probably happen in practice—that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed , but it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . it may be that the police decide that it is—it may have been two smacks , three smacks , so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious . so , it may be referred to the cps for a charging decision . we would then apply independently the same test , and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists , which takes us on to considering the public interest . in the circumstances that i 've described , every case is going to be unique on its own facts , but in the circumstances that i 've described , if it is just a light smack and it 's a one-off and there 's no history of this , it would probably be the sort of offence we 'd decide it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . sian gwenllian am : but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? dawn bowden am : okay . so , would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding , for instance , or it being useful in these circumstances , or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that ? sian gwenllian am : do you think that what we 're doing in wales will be emulated in england at some point ? barry hughes : i understand your point . there 's no change whatsoever to the burden of proof , nor to the standard of proof . if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . and we 've got to disprove that to the criminal standard , which is beyond a reasonable doubt . so , you can certainly see— . i can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter , to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial , and it would be our responsibility to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? that 's fine . i was expecting that answer . thank you for that , because i thought that was important to get on the record as well . we 're looking at a period of a couple of years after this act passes—if it does—for implementation . is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law ? barry hughes : i think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we 've built up with the welsh government and colleagues there . i think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward . we need involvement—iwan , for example , and the strategic implementation group . we have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that , and i believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected ; that we can liaise , in turn , with kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop . so , i think we 've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose—at least , 'adequate ' might sound a little— suzy davies am : sufficient . barry hughes : i can attempt an answer . i follow entirely where you 're going . i agree , the chances are pretty low , but they 're greater than they are presently . in other words , there is a greater degree of protection for children , and i think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out . i go back to what i was saying to you right at the start , about the evolution of the law , and the way we 've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the welsh government is , in my view , an evolution of the law . so , yes , there may not be many more prosecutions , but there wo n't be fewer than there are presently , because there 's a greater degree of protection for children . can i give you an example , which might illustrate the way in which things could be different ? this is one , which—i give credit to iwan for this , because he thought of it . if we take an adult with a small child—say , a four-year-old—in a supermarket , and the child is pulling cans off the shelves , it 's quite annoying , and they keep doing it and keep doing it . the parent remonstrates , and the parent ends up finding that verbal admonishment is inadequate , and smacks the child lightly on the legs , which does the trick and the child stops . presently , if someone in that supermarket were to report that to the police , i think the police would probably conclude that that is covered by the defence of reasonable chastisement . in other words , the evidential stage would n't be passed ; you do n't get on to consider the public interest . but if we have that same parent in there the following week , and you have the same happen again , presently , the defence would apply . now , there comes a point in time when the defence stops applying . if that defence did n't apply at all , and we had a sequence of three offences , the public interest test would kick in , if i may put it like that , pretty quickly , because it would be repeated behaviour . so , that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future , because the defence would not be available , so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly . so , when we apply the public interest test , the essence of it is about proportionality , and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending . we look at the age of the offender , the age of the victim , we look at the circumstances , we look at the impact upon the victim , we look at the impact that 's likely in relation to the suspect , and there is , within the code , a long list of matters that we take into account . some of them are fairly obvious , such as previous convictions . if someone 's got previous convictions for doing something wrong , it 's more likely they 're going to be prosecuted the next time . but there 's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow . mostly , it 's reasonably obvious ; the more serious an offence , the more likely you are to be prosecuted . normally , if there were an assault by someone else upon a child , outside the family , we would tend to take views from the parents of that child . in circumstances where both parents , arguably , are the suspects , we probably would n't be asking them . we would find another way , and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened . it may be that there are— . i can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used , effectively , in divorce proceedings , for example , where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there was n't . we 'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that . so , we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it . it 's not determinative , nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims . it 's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account . the way i might see it is that , clearly , policing 's not devolved , the cps is not devolved—the way i might see this is that , within wales , you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals . you ca n't direct the police or the cps to point people towards that , but , if you build a good infrastructure , it 's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction . i have to say i think that extremely unlikely . in the cps , we do n't have targets for securing convictions or not . clearly , we prosecute if we think that there 's a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but we have no targets . and i would also say , because the numbers here are likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets—it 's a tiny , tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean . sian gwenllian am : what about— ? there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? barry hughes : there is greater potential for it to increase . i think the numbers , again , will be tiny , and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners—whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses . regrettably , there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute . getting into the subtleties of the father , say , smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here . i can see it potentially arising . it 's not something that would cause me concern , simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce , sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication . sian gwenllian am : are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>
<s> how did the national police chiefs ' council help in out-of-court disposals ? </s> barry hughes : if you take an example—so , one of the examples that i 've heard discussed has been a child—a young child ; let 's say a five-year-old child by the side of a road—who darts to go out in the path of moving traffic . the parent grabs hold of the child and pulls them back . now , technically , taking hold of the child at that point is an assault , because it 's an unwanted imposition of physical force . but no-one 's going to say that 's anything like an assault that should come to the criminal courts . of course , that would be utter nonsense . there 's no hostility ; it 's simply taking hold of a child to protect them . at that point , the parent then seeks to admonish the child , tells them off and smacks the child on the legs . now , that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement . probably . but so much depends upon the circumstances , whether this is something that happens frequently with the child , the size of the child , the parent , the force of the slap , the way in which it 's imposed . so , that , i would say , sits at one end of the spectrum . as we move towards the other end of the spectrum , we might have repeated smacking , shouting , maybe hitting the child over the head as well . so , there is a spectrum of offending . towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature . there 'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police , and the police would take some form of action , and then , as we move through the tiers , it 'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the crown prosecution service for a charging decision . we would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it . and the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it 's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court . that would be very much towards the serious end of the spectrum of the type of behaviour that i 've just described to you . does that help to illustrate that , at one end , it 's relatively white and the other end it 's relatively black , but in the middle we have the shades of grey ? shall i address that in terms— ? okay . so , you are probably aware , but forgive me if i just explain quickly anyway , when we approach a file of material evidence submitted by the police we apply the code for crown prosecutors , which has a two-stage test . the first stage is whether there 's sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second stage is— . and you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied . if there is n't enough evidence , we do n't go on to consider whether it 's in the public interest , because we would n't put an offence before the courts if we did n't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction . so , we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied . so , to return to the point , if we have an offence where , let 's say , there is a light smack at the time , the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us . we do n't always agree with the police ; generally we do , but we do n't always agree . it 's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the crown prosecution service . so , if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it 's unlikely that would come to the cps , because they would look at it and say , 'reasonable chastisement provides for a defence . ' if that defence is removed , then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the cps . i would like to think—and i think this is what will probably happen in practice—that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed , but it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . it may be that the police decide that it is—it may have been two smacks , three smacks , so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious . so , it may be referred to the cps for a charging decision . we would then apply independently the same test , and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists , which takes us on to considering the public interest . in the circumstances that i 've described , every case is going to be unique on its own facts , but in the circumstances that i 've described , if it is just a light smack and it 's a one-off and there 's no history of this , it would probably be the sort of offence we 'd decide it would n't be in the public interest to prosecute . sian gwenllian am : but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? barry hughes : if this bill goes through , then it will remove a defence , which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the cps than beforehand , but it does n't necessarily mean they will refer it , because it will depend on the facts of each individual case . in addition to those that i 've mentioned , probably not . it boils down to the fact that there 's a defence in england for assaults upon children that is n't available in wales if this bill goes through , and then it 's dealing with the consequences of that . sian gwenllian am : do you think that what we 're doing in wales will be emulated in england at some point ? barry hughes : if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . and we 've got to disprove that to the criminal standard , which is beyond a reasonable doubt . so , you can certainly see— . i can see the potential for individuals who feel strongly about this to look to contest the matter , to not admit any wrongdoing at all and to take the matter to trial , and it would be our responsibility to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? barry hughes : simply because that 's a matter for the police . unlike in many other jurisdictions , we have no power whatsoever to direct the police , so if the police decide not to investigate— . i routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something , and they want us to do something about it and we ca n't . we ca n't direct the police . i can attempt an answer . i follow entirely where you 're going . i agree , the chances are pretty low , but they 're greater than they are presently . in other words , there is a greater degree of protection for children , and i think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out . i go back to what i was saying to you right at the start , about the evolution of the law , and the way we 've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the welsh government is , in my view , an evolution of the law . so , yes , there may not be many more prosecutions , but there wo n't be fewer than there are presently , because there 's a greater degree of protection for children . can i give you an example , which might illustrate the way in which things could be different ?

i think you 've mentioned that in your written evidence . barry hughes : i have to say i think that extremely unlikely . in the cps , we do n't have targets for securing convictions or not . clearly , we prosecute if we think that there 's a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but we have no targets . and i would also say , because the numbers here are likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets—it 's a tiny , tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean . sian gwenllian am : what about— ?

<s> summarize the discussion about unintended consequences . </s> sian gwenllian am : what are the areas of grey that you refer to ? can you give a few examples ? but that would mean that there could be more prosecutions at the softer end . because if you 're removing this—we 'll probably come on to that . but is n't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that ? do you know what i 'm saying ? dawn bowden am : i understand . okay . so you 're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you 're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications . what 's actually been your involvement with the government as they 've been developing this legislation ? but you would expect that to be something you would— that 's helpful , thank you . my final question , chair , is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation . barry hughes : if the defence argue that that act was— . so , we have to show that there 's been an unlawful assault . so , if we remove the defence of reasonable chastisement , in a sense that alters some things but it does n't alter the basic responsibility of the prosecution , which is to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt . and if the defence raise an argument and say , 'well , look , that was a lawful act ; i was only doing what i thought was reasonable in the circumstances ' , it 's for the crown to disprove that . suzy davies am : okay . that 's really helpful for us to understand that . obviously , when we 're talking about cps guidelines and all the rest , we 've already come some distance down the process , have n't we ? have you got any views on what might be done to prevent cases even coming as far as arrest ? because one of the things that we have to consider is that once you 're arrested , that is recorded somewhere and will appear in things like dbs checks in the future , even if it goes no further . do you have any views on how intervention might work better earlier on , even at the point of the knock at the door ? thank you for that , because i thought that was important to get on the record as well . we 're looking at a period of a couple of years after this act passes—if it does—for implementation . is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law ? barry hughes : i think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we 've built up with the welsh government and colleagues there . i think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward . we need involvement—iwan , for example , and the strategic implementation group . we have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that , and i believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected ; that we can liaise , in turn , with kwame and his colleagues in the headquarters to respond to things as they develop . so , i think we 've got a network of contacts built up here that is adequate for the purpose—at least , 'adequate ' might sound a little— suzy davies am : so , you 're confident , by 2022 , then , that you 'll have changes to the cps guidelines that are good to go , if you like . barry hughes : i can attempt an answer . i follow entirely where you 're going . i agree , the chances are pretty low , but they 're greater than they are presently . in other words , there is a greater degree of protection for children , and i think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out . i go back to what i was saying to you right at the start , about the evolution of the law , and the way we 've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the welsh government is , in my view , an evolution of the law . so , yes , there may not be many more prosecutions , but there wo n't be fewer than there are presently , because there 's a greater degree of protection for children . normally , if there were an assault by someone else upon a child , outside the family , we would tend to take views from the parents of that child . in circumstances where both parents , arguably , are the suspects , we probably would n't be asking them . we would find another way , and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened . it may be that there are— . i can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used , effectively , in divorce proceedings , for example , where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there was n't . we 'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that . so , we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it . it 's not determinative , nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims . it 's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account . that 's a really interesting question . there is a body of law that— the way i might see it is that , clearly , policing 's not devolved , the cps is not devolved—the way i might see this is that , within wales , you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals . you ca n't direct the police or the cps to point people towards that , but , if you build a good infrastructure , it 's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction . vikki howells am : and who would build that infrastructure , in your opinion ? barry hughes : i 'm not sure it 's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not . i can , however , say that i think the greater the level of awareness , the more likely it is that the act , if passed , will achieve its intentions . sian gwenllian am : thank you for that . in terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence , in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach , are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child , because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures ? what about— ? there is a target for unsolved crimes , or unsolved offences . what if they fall into that category ? is that an unintended consequence ? are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law ? barry hughes : there is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences , and i think probably about— . there are over— . from memory—please never hold me to this—but , from memory , there are something like 10,000 criminal offences ; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year . there are some offences on the statute— . i 've been prosecuting for 32 years now ; there are some offences that i 've never come near and probably never will . but , nonetheless , the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable . so , we have various defences to do with acts . i remember seeing some about antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there . well , they 're not something that we do , but it sets out what 's tolerant—what 's tolerable , sorry , and what is n't . so , the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is , for me , not a reason not to say that we should n't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable . clearly , we do n't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and do n't do . the criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate , which most people tend to understand . so , awareness is important and it comes back to that point . no . it 's a potential barrier , but i do n't think it is a barrier . there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in wales , and i know that the ministry of justice have taken action to deal with that , and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries . now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , we may have a problem , but , in turn , we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions . so , yes , it has the potential to serve as a barrier , but in practice , i do n't think it would be a barrier . i think , particularly given the very low numbers we 're talking about , we would be able to manage it . i 've got no significant concerns , i have to say . </s>

<s> summarize the meeting . </s> phd f : and he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . anyway , i thought ok , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in january , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . but , um , jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . so , i thought about that and i think it 's still possible , um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b : one offs ? yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . phd f : like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . professor d : now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz i ca because i i do n't disagree with that , but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too . uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , i actually feel the opposite need . i 'd like to have lots of different people . as many people here a a and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view . i 'd like to have many different speakers . so , um i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings , of somebody coming down from campus , and and uh , phd f : yeah , i definitely agree with that . professor d : well , ok , uh , first place , i i i do n't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz i i think that 's what we 're investigating , so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . postdoc e : well , e i just think , grad b : we all had the same thought . postdoc e : ok , now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . but the idea of language models , which are fund you know generally speaking uh , you know , t t terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data , professor d : well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . ok , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get . i mean , it it i think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the berkeley campus , probably most of it will be ok , phd f : i definitely agree with that , i mean , for this purpose . professor d : they 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're uh assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . phd f : cuz i mean , one remote possibility is that if we st if we inherited that equipment , if she were n't using it , could we set up a room in the linguistics department ? and and i mean , there there may be a lot more or or in psych , or in comp wherever , in another building where we could um , record people there . i think we 'd have a better chance right , but right . but if there were such a i mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . so it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . the idea is , if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth , and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something professor d : you know . grad b : yeah , i think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . another type of meeting . but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . phd f : use um , but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , you know , each person who 's interested in i mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . and so in my case , um , i think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . and so i 'm looking and thinking , `` well i 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . `` professor d : right . so that but i think that i 'm raising that cuz i think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , `` well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , `` well maybe you do n't . phd f : but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . there 's lots of cues you 're not gon na have . so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . professor d : i i i i i agree . phd f : otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d : uh but i i think that the uh i we ca n't really underestimate the difficulty should n't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . and so , uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , `` oh , we 'll just do it up there , `` if you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it wo n't happen quickly , it wo n't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o phd f : so then maybe we should try to bring people here . professor d : i think the first priority should be to pry { comment } to get try to get people to come here . we 're set up for it . phd f : yeah , i and i think we can get people to come here , that but the issue is you definitely wan na make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you do n't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . so { comment } well , it would be lunch afterwards . right . and they 'd have to do their digits or they do n't get dessert . grad b : um , i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered . yeah . so . they they originally they 've decided not to do go into speech . and they 'll say there 's no such thing . phd f : we need a wider sampling . grad b : yep . let them have their meeting . phd f : well , i thought that was i thought he meant , `` give them a music cd , `` like they g then he said a cd of the of their speech and i guess it depends of what kind of audience you 're talking to , but you know , i personally would not want a cd { comment } of my meeting , professor d : if you 're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you 'd like but it als it it it also i think builds up towards the goal . phd a : what if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? grad b : oh , yeah . i mean , anyone can have the transcripts . so . i thought we could point that out . postdoc e : i hav i have to uh raise a little eensy - weensy concern about doing th giving them the cd immediately , because of these issues of , you know , this kind of stuff , { comment } where maybe you know ? professor d : good point . that 's a very good point . phd f : right ? otherwise they 're not allowed to play it for anyone . postdoc e : things have been weeded out . phd f : otherwise we 'd need two lawyer stages . that 's a good point . professor d : yeah so that 's so let 's start with haas , and yeah . so , uh let 's see . so that was that topic , and then um , i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question for grad b : we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . so i uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , i i 'm in the midst of doing the p - files from uh , broadcast news . and it took eleven hours { comment } to do to uh copy it . and it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . well , it 's abbott . it 's abbott , so it just but it 's it 's a lot of data . so i 'm archiving it , and then i 'm gon na delete the files . postdoc e : one thing the good news about that that is that once once it 's archived , it 's pretty quick to get back . grad b : so . and that takes a while . postdoc e : yeah , that 's a good point . grad b : and so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . `` we `` by `` we `` of course i mean dave . professor d : so , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the broadcast news , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? phd a : ok , dc . grad b : and that has enough for about four more meetings right now . yeah , i mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons i do n't understand . phd a : so should , um one question i had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the aurora an and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk . is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b : we should put it onto the broadcast news one . that 's probably the best thing to do . and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . no . i mean , i can tell you , i just do n't know off the top of my head . but , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and i 've verified it . phd c : thank you for your information because i i read . eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , i work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the meeting recording project . grad b : throughout the meeting . phd c : eh , by a moment i have , eh , nnn , the , eh , n i i did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording , with eh , a exact mark . and the the idea is , eh , i i will use , eh , i want my idea is , eh , to eh { comment } to classify . phd a : these will be assigned by hand ? grad b : well , training , and validation . sure . mm - hmm . phd c : one , two , three . but no , by th by the moment n yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . professor d : which catege which category ? postdoc e : like a c phd c : no . by the moment , no . for for the by the @ @ no , @ @ because i i i i want to limit the the nnn , the the study . professor d : ok . got it . fine . so so phd a : so you 're not using all of the data . grad b : yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those . phd c : the all i exactly . yeah , be yeah . `` why ? why ? what 's the reason ? `` because i it 's the first study . the first professor d : oh , no no , it 's a perfectly sensible way to go . we just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing . postdoc e : yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . so , this is this is a subset . phd c : yeah . in the in the future , the the idea is to to extend the class , but eh , the the first idea because eh , i do n't know what hap what will happen { comment } with the study . professor d : we were jus just trying to understand postdoc e : yeah . yeah , we just wanted to know what the category was here . phd c : ok ? it 's the control set . it 's pure si pure silence { comment } with the with the machine on the on the roof . grad b : with the fan . postdoc e : well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . phd c : i have to to test , but eh i eh , em , i i i do n't remember what is the the name of the of the author , because i i have several i have eh , eh , em , eh , library tools , from eh , festival and of from edinburgh eh , from cambridge , eh , and from our department . a another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . but eh if you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you do n't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . grad b : deltas , professor d : i i mean , i think the other thing that one i mean , this is , i think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least see what i 'd i 'd let me tell you what i would do . i would take just a few features . instead of taking all the mfcc 's , or all the plp 's or whatever , i would just take a couple . and the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties . so if you 're just looking at a frame and a time , you do n't know anything about , you know , the structure of it over time , and so you may wan na build @ @ build a markov model of some sort uh , or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time . phd c : a model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class . and my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net professor d : ok , but , i i think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is right ? so again , i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in in in in ok ? if you 're talking about , say , twelfth twelfth - order uh mfcc 's or something like that it 's just way too much . grad b : right . mixed . phd c : i do n't know eh uh i i that eh the the result of the of the study eh with eh with eh this eh this speech , the mix speech eh will work exactly with the eh pda files . grad b : it would be interesting in itself to see . well , i think that would be an interesting result . professor d : and then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . and then , and you and you know , they wo n't work as well , but how m you know , how much that in fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we do n't have with the one and and so that 's uh , well , no , i mean , we we do n't have any rules , r really . i think i i think i think it 's it 's it 's a it 's an additional interesting question . phd a : mm - hmm professor d : uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . so , this is all pretty early stages . phd a : i see . postdoc e : there there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the pda , then some of the positional information goes away ? and then , and if they 're on the access { comment } on the axis of it , that was the other thing i was thinking . i mean , i know i n i know that 's a very important cue . but i 'm just i 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around a table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the pda , so we 're gon na have a lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker . phd a : but th i do n't think that matters , though . professor d : wherever they are . uh , well , basic he was looking at correlation . phd c : correlation , yeah . professor d : it 's spread out . well , we d yeah , we do n't have a third dimension there . yeah , so it 's but it 's almost but it 's almost a i think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . if someone just happens to be sitting right there then we wo n't get good information from it . postdoc e : yeah . ok . yeah yeah , ok . yeah . oh i 'm not i 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . i just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . grad b : and i think dan is still working on it . so . he actually he wrote me about it a little bit , so . professor d : uh @ @ { comment } but - but that 's i mean , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . grad b : then they 're much broader . yeah , we can do whatever we want . professor d : but but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a pda . they both have these , you know , big arrays on the wall . and you know , if you could do that , you 've got microphones all over the place phd c : hundred . grad b : and they had very precision . professor d : but , the reason why i have n't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , i 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . and you ca n't just always go , `` well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up `` . the other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else i 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two p d phd a : i still like my rug on the wall idea , so if anybody patents that , then grad b : in terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do . professor d : yeah . um , i i i i i would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there . grad b : well , i had a couple things that i did wan na bring out . one is , do we need to sign new these again ? professor d : oh , this morning we did n't sign anything cuz we said that if anybody had signed it already , we did n't have to . postdoc e : it 's slightly different . grad b : so we may wan na have everyone sign the new form . um , i had some things i wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff i 'm doing . but , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off . um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data . uh . postdoc e : well , should i i mean i have some results to present , but i mean i guess we wo n't have time to do that this time . but it seems like um the anonymization is uh , is also something that we might wan na discuss in greater length . professor d : um . i mean , wha what postdoc e : if if we 're about to wind down , i think what i would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps . phd a : we still have to do this , too , right ? grad b : no - well , we do n't have to do digits . professor d : well , why do n't we uh , so @ @ ok . @ @ { comment } it sounds like u uh , there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about . why do n't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly { comment } do them , and then and then and then and then and then we postdoc e : and i think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , i just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . i really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and i have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and i think we should grad b : alright . we 're we 're just we 're getting enough data now that i 'd sort of like to do it now , before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e : yeah , exactly . does n't matter if professor d : uh . um , yeah , i mean , t it does n't i mean , i 'm not knowledgeable about this , but it certainly does n't bother me to have someone 's first name in in the in the transcript . postdoc e : yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say `` your first name may arise in the course of the meetings `` . and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . well , i mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . grad b : you 're right , this is going to require more thought . professor d : yeah . l let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . uh i realize when you 're doing this that uh i mean , i did n't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . uh , and so , uh and so i was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . so i think what would be helpful would be uh , i and i 'll i 'll mention this to to liz and andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and i 'll i 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into into the agenda , but i 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . i 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then i 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , i i 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean , i 'm just always asking jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's there 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b : i mean , so if i 'm saying in a meeting , `` oh and bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so `` , postdoc e : and and but then we would need to label it . grad b : so . but i mean that does n't this does n't answer the the question . postdoc e : well , people are very flexible . you know ? i mean , so when we did this las last week , i felt that you know , now , andreas may , uh , @ @ { comment } uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . but i felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just were n't mentioning the name . so , people are really flexible . phd a : i mean , you have to really think , you know , about what you 're saying bef phd c : yeah . yeah , is professor d : `` is you know who up in you know where ? `` right ? use the grad b : yeah , darn ! i mean , what i was gon na say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names . phd a : right . i i think the i think i do n't know , my own two cents worth is that you do n't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . professor d : yeah . th - bec and so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says `` speaker - five `` there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is jose , grad b : and that violates our privacy . postdoc e : now , i i think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , university of washington 's use , ibm , sri . and i think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . but i but i don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how grad b : making some decisions ? you know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . postdoc e : you know . grad b : you know , like well , we can talk about that later . postdoc e : i think that 's risky . i think that the public should be the same . i think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . professor d : i i agree . i i agree with jane . postdoc e : for a bunch of reasons , legal . professor d : i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e : but i also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a : well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um for example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . if we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know grad b : and use the anonymized one through the transcript . postdoc e : excuse me . we we do need audio for discourse . professor d : and th and the other thing is if if if liz were here , what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue , postdoc e : well , you see ? so , it 's complicated . i think we have to think about w @ @ { comment } how . i think that this ca n't be decided today . grad b : yeah , ok , good point . i did n't think when i wrote you that email i was n't thinking it was a big can of worms , but i guess it is . discourse . postdoc e : well it discourse , you know also i wanted to make the point that that discourse is gon na be more than just looking at a transcript . grad b : yeah , ab absolutely . oh , yeah , sure . postdoc e : it 's gon na be looking at a t you know , and prosod prosodic stuff is involved , and that means you 're going to be listening to the audio , and then you come directly into this confronting this problem . phd a : maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse , grad b : did you read the paper on eurospeech ? professor d : oh , well that 's there 's an easy way to do that . jus - jus just play it all backwards . postdoc e : or do we just quit ? phd a : well , i was thinking that it must get kind of boring for the people who are gon na have to transcribe this grad b : well , except , we have the transcript . we have the actual numbers they 're reading , so we 're not necessarily depending on that . ok , i 'm gon na go off . </s>
<s> what was the advantage of using noisy-ors ? </s> phd f : that 's looks strange . grad b : now we 're on and it seems to be working . postdoc e : oh there we go . phd a : that is weird . it 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . professor d : yeah . postdoc e : was it a pause , or ? ok . was it on `` pause `` or something ? ok . do n't know . professor d : so uh so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which i think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . and that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and do n't have the time , uh , then they can run off . it 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , i think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . so , i th i think i think we should start doing that . um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh i do n't know . wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? is it phd a : well , great . what a deal . phd f : uh yeah . so he 's comes from a signal - processing background , but i liked him a lot cuz he 's very interested in higher level things , like language , and disfluencies and all kinds of eb maybe prosody , grad b : mm - hmm . great . phd f : but , um , jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . so , i thought about that and i think it 's still possible , um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time yeah , just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses , both to get the , um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it , like well , i was talking to morgan about things like summarization , or what 's this meeting about . i mean it 's very different if you have a group that 's just giving a report on what they did that week , versus coming to a decision and so forth . so . then i was um , talking to morgan about some new proposed work in this area , sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where i was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns , like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech , sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting , or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who did n't attend to listen to . and in that uh , regard , i thought we definitely w will need it 'd b it 'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains , or a few different kinds of meetings . so this this meeting is one of them , although i 'm not sure i can participate if i you know , i would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analysing later for things like summarization . grad b : mm - hmm . phd f : um , and then there are some others that menti that morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . grad b : right . yep . yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . phd f : so so if that were the case then i think we 'd have enough . grad b : so . mm - hmm . phd f : but basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting { comment } meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we did n't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b : yeah . phd f : but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . and then we need a couple that of we do n't wan na just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . grad b : yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . professor d : s so phd c : yeah . phd f : see , i 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting . grad b : yeah , we we 've only had three . professor d : yeah . postdoc e : can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . because i think if you just say an and in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes you know . but you know , i think i 've been i 've i i 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . and and the english you 'd have the language models would be really hard to build because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a phd f : it has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d : so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . uh , that 's the first point . the second point is um i think that for some time now , going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and i th i think that postdoc e : well , yeah . i 'm just saying fluency . professor d : i guess i maybe hmm . i postdoc e : because otherwise y you do n't have the ability to have uh , so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that 's the worst possible case . if you have people who are using english as a as an interlanguage because they they do n't uh , they ca n't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage is n't really a match to any existing , uh , language model , professor d : uh - huh . well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . postdoc e : well oh . but the thing is , i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that professor d : uh - huh . postdoc e : so y so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , i do n't see that there 's an argument that 's that 's my point . which which includes both top - down and bottom - up . phd c : `` age - ist `` . yeah . yeah . oh - yeah . grad b : right ? that 's very easy , phd c : ye - yeah , yeah . grad b : but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . phd c : yeah . professor d : actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . we realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , ok , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . so , um , it 's true that we wan na be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . but on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . so , a a as per the example that we wan na have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings but we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's ok too . uh , i we realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? i mean , we really wan na have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . but what about for th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you do n't really need the distant microphone . phd f : right , i mean , i c i think there 's grad b : and you do n't really need the close microphone , you mean . professor d : you actually do n't . phd c : yeah . phd f : yea - yeah yeah , you actually do n't really even need any fancy microphone . postdoc e : which one did you mean ? professor d : you d you do n't ne it does n't you just need some microphone , somewhere . grad b : ye - yeah . yep . phd f : you can use found data . and so in my case , um , i think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . and so i 'm looking and thinking , `` well i 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . `` but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . there 's lots of cues you 're not gon na have . grad b : the problem with engineers is `` beep . `` professor d : i 'm sorry . postdoc e : yeah , that 's a good point . wow . wow . phd a : mm - hmm . hmm . i 've been looking at the , uh , aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . one was called aurora , one was spanish , which was carmen 's spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , spine . and so , um , i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . so , um , i realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the cd - rom type data , the the static data . so i moved that , and then um , i asked him to check out and see if it was ok . before i actually deleted the old stuff , um , but i have n't heard back yet . i told him he could delete it if he wanted to , i have n't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . and then carmen 's stuff , i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to xa , i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . and so , i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . and then i lo have n't done any of the aurora stuff . i have to meet with , uh , stephane to do that . so . professor d : yeah . phd a : is that the one that has is that dc ? professor d : yeah . grad b : i do n't remember . th - i think it 's dc - it 's whatever that one is . postdoc e : i 'm glad to hear it . glad to hear it . phd c : heh ? that 's eh , yet b b yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh `` why . `` my my idea is to work i i i do i don i do n't @ @ i do n't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because i i i have n't a lot eh , enough time to to to work . uh , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . sorry ? no , i i plan to do that . grad b : ok . darn ! phd c : eh , um , eh this information eh , with eh , exactly time marks eh , for the overlapping zones eh overlapping zone , and eh , a speaker a a pure speech eh , eh , speaker zone . i mean , eh zones eh of eh speech of eh , one speaker without any any eh , noise eh , any any acoustic event eh that eh , eh , w eh , is not eh , speech , real speech . and , i need t true eh , silence for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify . grad b : right . phd c : the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones . the idea is to eh to use eh , i 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . and my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . and my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . professor d : mm - hmm . postdoc e : which means that we 'd still you 'd hear the grad b : yeah , fans . phd c : yeah , acoustic with this . { comment } with with , yeah , the background . postdoc e : yeah . { comment } that 's interesting . this is like a ground level , with it 's not it 's not total silence . phd c : eh , i i mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d : mm - hmm . phd c : eh , eh , event eh , which , eh , eh , has , eh eh , a hard effect of distorti spectral distortion in the in the eh speech . professor d : mm - hmm . grad b : whew ! mm - hmm . postdoc e : great . great . excellent . glad to hear it . good . phd c : and the the idea is , eh , i i will use , eh , i want my idea is , eh , to eh { comment } to classify . i i need eh , the exact eh , mark of the different , eh , eh , zones because i i want to put , eh , for eh , each frame a label indicating . it 's a sup supervised and , eh , hierarchical clustering process . i i i put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong . eh , i mean , the class you will overlapping speech `` overlapping `` is a class , eh , `` speech `` @ @ the class that 's grad b : nonspeech . phd c : speech yeah . postdoc e : so this is un ok , and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time , or or a speaker and a breath overlapping , someone else 's breath , or or clicking , overlapping with speech so , that that 's all those possibilities in the top one . yeah , that 's right . that 's my question . so it 's like a signal - noise situation . yeah . grad b : `` tone `` , whatever . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd c : and and i have to because , in general the pitch tracker , does n't work { comment } very well and grad b : bad . right . but , you know , as a feature , it might be ok . so , we do n't know . phd c : yeah . yeah . this this is and th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh fec for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . and in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b : supervised clustering . mm - hmm . postdoc e : mm - hmm . phd c : and the second is try to eh , to use some ideas eh , similar to the linear discriminant analysis . grad b : mm - hmm . phd c : eh ? eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters . grad b : mm - hmm . what sort of classifier ar ? unimodal ? phd c : is yeah ? w with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . postdoc e : mm - hmm . grad b : right . phd c : but eh what 's the p what is my idea ? what 's the problem i i i i see in in in if you you use the the neural network ? if w when this kind of eh , mmm , cluster , clustering algorithm to can test , to can eh observe what happened you you ca n't you ca n't eh , eh put up with your hand { comment } in the different parameter , but eh if you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you do n't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . professor d : ok ? like like c - one , c - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . but i think this is a good place to start . but do n't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is do n't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's k - nearest - neighbors , you still wo n't know look at at som some picture that shows you , `` here 's these things uh , uh are offer some separation . `` and , uh , in lpc , uh , the thing to particularly look at is , i think is something like , uh , the residual phd c : yeah . professor d : um so . phd c : yeah . s postdoc e : can i ask ? it strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . so , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gon na be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . phd c : yeah , because yeah yeah . yeah . yeah . i yeah . but eh i i is my my my own vision , of the of the project . grad b : so , some sort of that 's postdoc e : mm - hmm . professor d : mm - hmm . phd c : eh , because it 's a a great project . but eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh i think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . one one of these is to eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . and for that , if you do n't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , i think the ike criterion or bic criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . and probably . { comment } i i i i would like to to t prove . uh , probably . when you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter mf - mfcc . you you have to to to find you can find the the mark . you can find the nnn , the the acoustic change . but eh eh i i understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only { comment } a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , i suppose . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd c : because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer . that , you know , i i i think is the idea . and so eh the , nnn the the system eh will have two models . professor d : so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . well , you 'll you 'll get a feeling for what 's happening , you know , so if you look at suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , and so i i again , if you take a few of these things that are are prob um { comment } promising features and look at them in pairs , uh , i think you 'll have much more of a sense of `` ok , i now have uh , doing a bunch of these analyses , i now have ten likely candidates . `` and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine . phd a : i 've got a question . phd c : but eh , eh eh eh eh i do n't know it is the first eh way to to do that and i would eh like to to know what eh , your opinion . eh all this study in the f in the first moment , i i w i i will pretend to do { comment } with eh eh equalizes speech . the the equalizes speech , the speech eh , the mixes of speech . postdoc e : so it 's messier . grad b : it would be interesting in itself to see . well , i think that would be an interesting result . yeah . but it i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and and do n't postdoc e : that 's good . phd c : but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the pda speech files . professor d : right . phd c : but it i i i i think it will be important . because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you i i i have seen the the the speech file from eh pda , and s some parts is { comment } very difficult because you you do n't see the spectrum the spectrogram . grad b : right . yeah , they 're totally hidden . professor d : yeah . yeah . well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd c : you have a question . phd a : yeah , i maybe this is a dumb question , but w i thought it would be i thought it would be easier if you used a pda well , it 's postdoc e : it seems to me that that it 's not a p uh , you know , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is is a little bit complicated . phd c : i i i think sorry . i i i think because the the the distance between the two microph eh , microphone , eh , in the pda is very near . but it 's uh from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural eh problem eh , with information , because i i found difference between the the speech from from each micro eh , in the pda . postdoc e : great . no , i do n't mean to discourage that at all . phd c : it will be more interesting to study the pzm because the the the separation i i think professor d : uh @ @ { comment } but - but that 's i mean , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . but but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a pda . phd a : that 's what i was asking about , what are the constraints ? postdoc e : ok , that 's what i 'm asking . ok , so the the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . those we wo n't be able to change . if someone says `` hey , roger so - and - so `` . grad b : we do n't we wan na we ha we want the transcript to be `` roger `` . phd a : yeah . grad b : because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wan na avoid that . postdoc e : ok , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gon na use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have `` roger `` be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was `` roger `` be `` frank `` , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . grad b : oh . ugh ! that 's a good point . postdoc e : now , if you want to , you know , i mean , in some cases , i i i know that susan ervin - tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except and and i cer and i so , i mean , the question then becomes one level back . um , how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ? well , on the one hand , uh , it 's not a full identity , we 're taking all these precautions , um and they 'll be taking precautions , which are probably even the more important ones , to they 'll be reviewing the transcripts , to see if there 's something they do n't like { comment } ok . so , maybe , uh , maybe that 's enough protection . on the other hand , this is a small this is a small pool , and people who say things about topic x e who are researchers and well - known in the field , they 'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name . however , taking one step further back , they 'd be identifiable anyway , even if we changed all the names . grad b : right . postdoc e : so , is it really , um { comment } you know ? now , in terms of like so i i did some results , which i 'll report on n next time , which do mention individual speakers by name . grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc e : now , there , the human subjects committee is very precise . you do n't wan na mention subjects by name in published reports . now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . and someone who looked s i you know , `` you raised the point , so - and - so `` , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who `` you `` was . professor d : yeah . grad b : i i 'm thinking too much . postdoc e : and ac { comment } and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , i was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d : yeah , i was too . yeah . postdoc e : and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . well , i mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . phd c : yeah . professor d : yeah . grad b : but that 's because i 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so i think that 's a really good point . professor d : yeah . yeah . l let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . uh i realize when you 're doing this that uh i mean , i did n't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . uh , and so , uh and so i was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . so i think what would be helpful would be uh , i and i 'll i 'll mention this to to liz and andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and i 'll i 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into into the agenda , postdoc e : ok . sure . professor d : but i 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . i 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then i 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , i i 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean , i 'm just always asking jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's there 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . postdoc e : how do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b : i mean , so if i 'm saying in a meeting , `` oh and bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so `` , yeah , really . well , the current one they do n't do speaker identity . professor d : so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . uh yu - ching , yu - ching . yeah . postdoc e : oh , uh yu - ching ? yu - ching ? grad b : y yu - ching . professor d : and it and it may very well be i mean , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . postdoc e : yeah . professor d : and the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . postdoc e : you know uh - huh . you know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . grad b : hmm . for for acoustics you do n't but for discourse you do . professor d : yeah . if if if if someone says , uh , `` what what is jose doing ? `` and then jose says something , you need to know that that was jose responding . grad b : ugh , { comment } that 's a problem . postdoc e : well , people are very flexible . you know ? i mean , so when we did this las last week , i felt that you know , now , andreas may , uh , @ @ { comment } uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . grad b : uh ok , we 'll quickly do digits . professor d : let 's do digits . yeah , we we we already missed the party . </s>
<s> what was suggested to incorporate the eva into the bayes-net ? </s> professor d : yeah . phd f : so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . anyway , i thought ok , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in january , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . but , um , jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . so , i thought about that and i think it 's still possible , um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time so so if that were the case then i think we 'd have enough . grad b : um professor d : now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz i ca because i i do n't disagree with that , but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too . uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , i actually feel the opposite need . i 'd like to have lots of different people . i mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , phd f : yeah , i definitely agree with that . postdoc e : can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . because i think if you just say an and in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes you know . but you know , i think i 've been i 've i i 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . and and the english you 'd have the language models would be really hard to build professor d : well , you want to i postdoc e : because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a professor d : well , ok , uh , first place , i i i do n't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz i i think that 's what we 're investigating , postdoc e : well , e i just think , professor d : it 's the the habits are already burnt in . but postdoc e : ok , now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . if you have a choice between people who are pr more proficient in um , i more fluent , more more close to being academic english , then it would seem to me to be a good thing . this is the worst case scenario . professor d : well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . postdoc e : and well oh . but the thing is , i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that and i 'm not objecting to accents . so y so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , i do n't see that there 's an argument i 'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . that 's that 's my point . which which includes both top - down and bottom - up . phd f : i definitely agree with that , i mean , for this purpose . grad b : well , not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . what 's that ? well , age - ist . { comment } the `` eighteen `` is because of the consent form . phd f : right , yeah . phd c : `` age - ist `` . yeah . yeah . postdoc e : yeah , that 's true . grad b : i think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . we 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . phd f : right , but right . but if there were such a i mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . so it 's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware . grad b : that 's true . phd f : i i think it 's not out of the question . grad b : but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . phd c : yeah . professor d : actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . we realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , ok , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . so , um , it 's true that we wan na be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . but on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . so , a a as per the example that we wan na have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings but we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's ok too . uh , i we realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? i mean , we really wan na have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . but what about for th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you do n't really need the distant microphone . you actually do n't . phd c : yeah . professor d : you d you do n't ne it does n't you just need some microphone , somewhere . but i mean phd f : use um , but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , you know , each person who 's interested in i mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . and so in my case , um , i think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . grad b : not enough for others , right . phd f : and so i 'm looking and thinking , `` well i 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . `` professor d : right . so that grad b : yeah . for some of it . professor d : maybe if if if really all you want is to have a a a recording that 's good enough to get a uh , a transcription from later , you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording . i mean , we we could have a fairly we could just get a dat machine and phd f : so that might be true , you may say for instance , summarization , or something that sounds very language oriented . you may say well , `` oh yeah , you just do that from transcripts of a radio show . `` i mean , you do n't even need the speech signal . but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . there 's lots of cues you 're not gon na have . so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . otherwise , you know , lots of other sites can propose individual studies , so professor d : uh but i i think that the uh i we ca n't really underestimate the difficulty should n't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . phd f : so then maybe we should try to bring people here . i mean , that 's that 's ok , so yeah , i and i think we can get people to come here , that but the issue is you definitely wan na make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you do n't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . grad b : and they 'll say there 's no such thing . phd f : well , i know , i should n't say that . grad b : the problem with engineers is `` beep . `` professor d : and give them so if they want a basically and audio record of their but you 'll ge appreciate , you know , where it 's useful and where it 's useless , phd f : but we might need a little more to incentivize them , { comment } that 's all . that 's a good point . grad b : and it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space . postdoc e : yeah , that 's a good point . professor d : so , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the broadcast news , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? yeah . yeah . phd a : ok , i but the stuff i 'm moving from aurora is on the dc disk that we so should , um one question i had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the aurora an and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk . is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b : we should put it onto the broadcast news one . that 's probably the best thing to do . and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . phd a : ok . right . right . do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? ok . phd c : heh ? that 's eh , yet b b yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh `` why . `` postdoc e : yeah . which means that we 'd still you 'd hear the yeah . { comment } that 's interesting . this is like a ground level , with it 's not it 's not total silence . grad b : so so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ? phd c : and the the idea is , eh , i i will use , eh , i want my idea is , eh , to eh { comment } to classify . grad b : nonspeech . postdoc e : yeah , that 's right . that 's my question . professor d : right , so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a nonspeech event at the same time ? phd c : yeah , be yeah . `` why ? why ? what 's the reason ? `` because i it 's the first study . the first professor d : what you well w i i think what you m i think what you mean is that it 's nonspeech segments that do n't have impulsive noises . postdoc e : so it 's like a signal - noise situation . yeah . professor d : well yeah . postdoc e : well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . phd c : and and i have to because , in general the pitch tracker , does n't work { comment } very well and is yeah ? w with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . a another possibility it to use eh a netw netw a neural network . grad b : right , you ca n't analyse it . phd c : but eh if you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you do n't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . yeah . yeah . professor d : well , this is n't tru if if if you really wonder what different if if phd c : yeah . but professor d : yeah , then a decision tree is really good , but the thing is here he 's he 's not he 's not like he has one you know , a bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , a all these cepstral coefficients , and so forth , in which case a a any reasonable classifier is gon na be a mess , and it 's gon na be hard to figure out what what uh phd c : and professor d : i i mean , i think the other thing that one i mean , this is , i think a good thing to do , to sort of look at these things at least see what i 'd i 'd let me tell you what i would do . i would take just a few features . instead of taking all the mfcc 's , or all the plp 's or whatever , i would just take a couple . but i think this is a good place to start . but do n't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is do n't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's k - nearest - neighbors , you still wo n't know what it 's doing , even you know it 's uh , i think to know what it 's to have a better feeling for what it 's postdoc e : can i ask ? it strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . so , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gon na be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . grad b : so , some sort of that 's phd c : and probably . { comment } i i i i would like to to t prove . uh , probably . when you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter mf - mfcc . you you have to to to find you can find the the mark . you can find the nnn , the the acoustic change . but eh eh i i understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only { comment } a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone . because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , i suppose . you you will pretend { comment } to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm professor d : ok , but , i i think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . right ? so again , i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh , in in in in so if you look at suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients , right ? and with lpc , i think lpc per se is n't gon na tell you much more than than than the other , maybe . uh , and uh on the other hand , the lpc residual , the energy in the lpc residual , will say how well , uh the low - order lpc model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . grad b : with phd c : and , i do n't know grad b : it would be interesting in itself to see . well , i think that would be an interesting result . professor d : n u we well , i think i think i think it 's not a it 's not at all unreasonable . it makes sense to start with the simpler signal because if you have features which do n't are n't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway . and then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . and then , and you and you know , they wo n't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b : yeah . but it i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and and do n't professor d : that 's well , the it it 's it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you 're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases . sure . phd c : but but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the pda speech files . but it i i i i think it will be important . because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you i i i have seen the the the speech file from eh pda , and s some parts is { comment } very difficult because you you do n't see the spectrum the spectrogram . professor d : yeah . yeah . well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . phd c : but i suppose phd a : yeah , i maybe this is a dumb question , but w i thought it would be i thought it would be easier if you used a pda grad b : well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one . phd a : i mean , is is that violation of the professor d : i mean , i think you wan na know whether you can do it with one , because you know it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two . uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . but no , you 're absolutely right . that 's a good thing to consider . postdoc e : there there is a complication though , and that is if a person turns their back to the to the pda , then some of the positional information goes away ? and then , and if they 're on the access { comment } on the axis of it , that was the other thing i was thinking . grad b : and phd a : well , it 's phd c : yeah . postdoc e : and and and in his case , i mean , he 's closer to it anyway . grad b : but it 's another source of information . phd a : i would guess professor d : ok . so when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l in in the lag . grad b : or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you could n't tell the difference either . postdoc e : it seems like that would be pretty strong . and so my point was just that it 's it 's gon na be differentially differentially varia valuable . professor d : but it 's almost but it 's almost a i think what you 're talking about i there 's two things . uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity . so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just do n't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how grad b : but postdoc e : oh i 'm not i 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . i just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d : yeah . mm - hmm . postdoc e : great . no , i do n't mean to discourage that at all . professor d : i mean , the other thing you can do uh , if i mean , i we 're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the pda . but if you h put a third in , you could put in the other axis . and then you know then you 're sort of yeah , then then you pretty much could cover phd c : it will be more interesting to study the pzm because the the the separation i i think professor d : uh @ @ { comment } but - but that 's i mean , we can we 'll be all of this is there for us to study . but but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a pda . well , that 's that 's the constraint of one question that i think both adam and i were were were interested in . grad b : well professor d : but , the reason why i have n't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , i 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . and you ca n't just always go , `` well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up `` . phd a : no , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . it has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the pda . grad b : but i think professor d : the other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else i 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two p d grad b : in terms of postdoc e : if if we 're about to wind down , i think what i would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps . ok , that 's what i 'm asking . and i think the anonymization , if y if you want to proceed with that now , i just think that that 's that 's a discussion which also n really deserves a lo a you know , more that just a minute . i really do think that , because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself , you and i have discussed it previously , and there are different ways that people approach it , e and i think we should ok , so the the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . those we wo n't be able to change . if someone says `` hey , roger so - and - so `` . now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gon na put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gon na put it in the text where he says `` hey roger `` or are we gon na put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b : no , because then that would give you a mapping , and you do n't wan na have a mapping . phd a : i do n't grad b : no . because that would give you a mapping between the speaker 's real name and the tag we 're using , and we do n't want phd a : right , you do n't wan na do that . grad b : we do n't we wan na we ha we want the transcript to be `` roger `` . phd a : yeah . grad b : because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wan na avoid that . postdoc e : ok , well , but then there 's this issue of if we 're gon na use this for a discourse type of thing , then and , you know , liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who 's who 's the addressee and all , then to have `` roger `` be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was `` roger `` be `` frank `` , that 's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis . grad b : oh . ugh ! that 's a good point . postdoc e : now , if you want to , you know , i mean , in some cases , i i i know that susan ervin - tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except so , is it really , um { comment } you know ? yeah , exactly . does n't matter if professor d : and so phd a : well postdoc e : yeah , and and you know , even more i i uh , immediate than that just being able to , uh well , it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who 's speaking and who 's speaking to whom , cuz that can be important . s i you know , `` you raised the point , so - and - so `` , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who `` you `` was . professor d : yeah . postdoc e : and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . well , i mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . phd c : yeah . professor d : yeah . grad b : but that 's because i 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so i think that 's a really good point . professor d : yeah . but i 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . i 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then i 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , i i 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean , i 'm just always asking jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's there 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b : how will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ? do you know what i 'm saying ? postdoc e : how do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b : i mean , so if i 'm saying in a meeting , `` oh and bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so `` , if you 're doing yeah , @ @ they 're just gon na write `` bob `` . and so . if you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis , yeah , really . professor d : i mean , they 're gon na say speaker - one , or speaker - two or speaker i mean i i and it and it may very well be i mean , since they 're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about , uh , it being the same speaker , they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker , that 'll be speaker - two . postdoc e : yeah . you know uh - huh . you know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . and and but then we would need to label it . professor d : but that grad b : the p it 's a good point , `` which what do you do for discourse tracking ? `` hmm . for for acoustics you do n't but for discourse you do . professor d : well , you do . yeah . if if if if someone says , uh , `` what what is jose doing ? `` and then jose says something , you need to know that that was jose responding . phd a : i i think the i think i do n't know , my own two cents worth is that you do n't do anything about what 's in the recordings , you only anonymize to the extent you can , the speakers have signed the forms and all . grad b : sure but , h then you have to know that jose is speaker - one and professor d : and so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says `` speaker - five `` there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is jose , postdoc e : now , i i think that we have these two phases in the in the data , which is the one which is o our use , university of washington 's use , ibm , sri . and i think also , when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world , we have to . but i but i don that 's that 's a long way from now and and it 's a matter of between now and then of d of deciding how i i it you know , it may be s that we we 'll need to do something like actually x out that part of the um the audio , and just put in brackets `` speaker - one `` . grad b : you know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . professor d : i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and phd a : well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um for example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . if we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it 's not longer useful for discourse , you know but if you release both postdoc e : yeah . but i i also wan na say that people grad b : and then it would n't meet match the audio anymore . but it would be still useful for the phd a : but if both of those are publically available grad b : but they right . professor d : oh , well that 's there 's an easy way to do that . jus - jus just play it all backwards . </s>
<s> what was said about data collection ? </s> grad b : now we 're on and it seems to be working . postdoc e : this looks good . phd a : it 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . grad b : yep , we will . one of these days . postdoc e : was it a pause , or ? ok . was it on `` pause `` or something ? ok . do n't know . professor d : so uh so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which i think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . and that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and do n't have the time , uh , then they can run off . it 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , i think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . so , i th i think i think we should start doing that . um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh i do n't know . wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? is it phd f : um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting i was griping about wanting to get more data and i i talked about this with jane and adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wan na work with us , phd a : well , great . phd f : th the guy that was at the last meeting . phd a : great . phd f : and he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , phd a : what a deal . phd f : so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . anyway , i thought ok , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in january , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . but , um , jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . so , i thought about that and i think it 's still possible , um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b : one offs ? right . yep . yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . phd f : but basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting { comment } meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we did n't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b : yeah . yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . phd c : yeah . phd f : see , i 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting . grad b : yeah , we we 've only had three . professor d : yeah . phd f : right . right . professor d : i mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , postdoc e : can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . because i think if you just say an and in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes you know . but you know , i think i 've been i 've i i 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . and and the english you 'd have the language models would be really hard to build professor d : well , ok , uh , first place , i i i do n't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz i i think that 's what we 're investigating , so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . postdoc e : oh , i see . oh , interesting ! professor d : uh , that 's the first point . the second point is um i think that for some time now , going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and i th i think that grad b : yeah . yeah , just talking about . professor d : it 's the the habits are already burnt in . well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . postdoc e : well oh . but the thing is , i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that that 's that 's my point . which which includes both top - down and bottom - up . yes , that 's fine . that 's fine . exactly . and my point in m in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . professor d : but ok . ok . grad b : what 's that ? well , age - ist . { comment } the `` eighteen `` is because of the consent form . phd c : `` age - ist `` . yeah . yeah . professor d : they 're they 're yeah , they 're d they 're uh assessing whether they should do that or y do something else , hopefully over the next few weeks . grad b : right ? that 's very easy , but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . phd f : and so in my case , um , i think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . there 's lots of cues you 're not gon na have . professor d : and so , uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , `` oh , we 'll just do it up there , `` grad b : here . professor d : i think the first priority should be to pry { comment } to get try to get people to come here . we 're set up for it . postdoc e : i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea . phd a : no crunchy food . grad b : um , i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered . and they 'll say there 's no such thing . phd a : `` beep . `` what if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? postdoc e : things have been weeded out . phd f : i will be here full - time next week . grad b : ok , see you . we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings . so i uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving , i i 'm in the midst of doing the p - files from uh , broadcast news . and it took eleven hours { comment } to do to uh copy it . phd c : eleven ? grad b : and it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . phd a : where did you copy it to ? grad b : well , it 's abbott . it 's abbott , so it just but it 's it 's a lot of data . phd a : oh , on the tape . professor d : i 'm sorry . grad b : so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space . phd c : eleven hours ? postdoc e : yeah , that 's a good point . phd a : oh ! hunh ! grad b : no , the the these are the p - files from broadcast news , which are regeneratable regeneratable postdoc e : ok . oh , good . i see . grad b : and so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . postdoc e : wow . wow . phd a : is there a difference in price or something ? grad b : and so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors . `` we `` by `` we `` of course i mean dave . phd a : hmm . i 've been looking at the , uh , aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . one was called aurora , one was spanish , which was carmen 's spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , spine . and so , um , i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . so , um , i realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the cd - rom type data , the the static data . so i moved that , and then um , i asked him to check out and see if it was ok . before i actually deleted the old stuff , um , but i have n't heard back yet . i told him he could delete it if he wanted to , i have n't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . and then carmen 's stuff , i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to xa , i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . and so , i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . and then i lo have n't done any of the aurora stuff . i have to meet with , uh , stephane to do that . so . professor d : so , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the broadcast news , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b : yep . so , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where meeting recorder is , and that 's probably enough for about four meetings . phd a : is that the one that has is that dc ? grad b : and that has enough for about four more meetings right now . yeah , i mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons i do n't understand . phd a : so should , um one question i had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the aurora an and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk . is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b : we should put it onto the broadcast news one . that 's probably the best thing to do . and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . phd a : ok . right . right . do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? ok . phd c : i have , eh , the result of my work during the last days . thank you for your information because i i read . eh , and the the last , eh , days , eh , i work , eh , in my house , eh , in a lot of ways and thinking , reading eh , different things about the the meeting recording project . postdoc e : i 'm glad to hear it . glad to hear it . grad b : i 've seen it already . mm - hmm . oh , you did that by hand ? phd c : heh ? that 's eh , yet b b yeah , by b b by hand by hand because , eh , eh `` why . `` my my idea is to work i i i do i don i do n't @ @ i do n't know , eh , if , eh , it will be possible because i i i have n't a lot eh , enough time to to to work . uh , only just eh , six months , as you know , but , eh , my idea is , eh , is very interesting to to work in in the line of , eh , automatic segmenter . eh but eh , eh , in my opinion , we need eh , eh , a reference eh session to t to to evaluate the the the tool . grad b : yes , absolutely . and so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c : sorry ? no , i i plan to do that . grad b : ok . darn ! right . phd c : the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones . the idea is to eh to use eh , i 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . postdoc e : yeah . { comment } that 's interesting . this is like a ground level , with it 's not it 's not total silence . phd c : eh , i i mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , postdoc e : great . great . excellent . glad to hear it . good . professor d : go ahead . phd c : and the the idea is , eh , i i will use , eh , i want my idea is , eh , to eh { comment } to classify . phd a : these will be assigned by hand ? phd c : because , eh , my idea is , eh , in in the first session , i need , eh , i i need , eh , to be sure that the information eh , that , eh , i i will cluster , is is right . because , eh , eh , if not , eh , i will i will , eh , return to the speech file to analyze eh , what is the problems , one , two , three . but no , by th by the moment n yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . no . by the moment , no . professor d : ok . got it . fine . so so phd c : yeah , be yeah . `` why ? why ? what 's the reason ? `` because i it 's the first study . the first postdoc e : well , steady state . grad b : right . so fine . go on . postdoc e : well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . phd c : and and i have to because , in general the pitch tracker , does n't work { comment } very well and yeah . yeah . this this is and th the idea is to to , eh , to obtain , eh , for example , eh , eh diff eh , eh , different well , no , a great number of eh fec for example , eh , eh , twenty - five , eh , thirty thirty parameters , eh , for for each one . and in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data grad b : right . phd c : but eh if you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you do n't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d : ok ? like like c - one , c - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . but i think this is a good place to start . but do n't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is do n't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's k - nearest - neighbors , you still wo n't know phd c : yeah . professor d : um so . grad b : i 'm i 'm i 'm sorry , i did n't understand you what you said . what what model ? professor d : ok , but , i i think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is right ? and with lpc , i think lpc per se is n't gon na tell you much more than than than the other , maybe . uh , and uh on the other hand , the lpc residual , the energy in the lpc residual , will say how well , uh the low - order lpc model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty well , for w for for one . phd a : i 've got a question . phd c : sorry . postdoc e : `` mixed `` . thank you . grad b : it would be interesting in itself to see . well , i think that would be an interesting result . professor d : and so , if you can get @ @ { comment } uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , { comment } and then collect , uh in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . and then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . and then , and you and you know , they wo n't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b : yeah . but it i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and and do n't postdoc e : that 's good . phd c : but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the pda speech files . professor d : right . grad b : right . yeah , they 're totally hidden . are probably better , yep . phd c : you have a question . phd a : right . right . ok . professor d : so , this is all pretty early stages . phd a : well , it 's professor d : wherever they are . phd a : what looked different ? ok . ok . professor d : yeah . the - the oh , i 'm sorry , postdoc e : yeah . ok . yeah yeah , ok . yeah . grad b : and i think dan is still working on it . so . he actually he wrote me about it a little bit , so . postdoc e : great . no , i do n't mean to discourage that at all . professor d : but but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a pda . phd a : oh ! i saw a demo . phd c : hundred . phd a : that is cool . professor d : but , the reason why i have n't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , i 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . and you ca n't just always go , `` well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up `` . phd a : it has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the pda . postdoc e : if if we 're about to wind down , i think what i would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps . grad b : ok , go ahead , jane . postdoc e : i 'd oh , i 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e could i do that next week maybe ? professor d : ok . oh , yeah . sure . grad b : alright . we 're we 're just we 're getting enough data now that i 'd sort of like to do it now , before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e : well , ok . ok , so the the short thing is um , we have uh , tape recording uh , uh , sorry , digitized recor recordings . those we wo n't be able to change . if someone says `` hey , roger so - and - so `` . grad b : oh . ugh ! that 's a good point . postdoc e : now , if you want to , you know , i mean , in some cases , i i i know that susan ervin - tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d : yeah yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . grad b : right . postdoc e : so , is it really , um { comment } you know ? yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say `` your first name may arise in the course of the meetings `` . s i you know , `` you raised the point , so - and - so `` , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who `` you `` was . and ac { comment } and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , i was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d : yeah , i was too . yeah . postdoc e : and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . well , i mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . grad b : but that 's because i 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so i think that 's a really good point . you 're right , this is going to require more thought . postdoc e : ok . sure . professor d : but i 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . i 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then i 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , i i 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean , i 'm just always asking jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's there 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . postdoc e : oh , it 's not a problem . not a problem . yeah . i just i just could n't do it in two minutes . how do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b : i mean , so if i 'm saying in a meeting , `` oh and bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so `` , yeah , really . professor d : uh yu - ching , yu - ching . yeah . postdoc e : oh , uh yu - ching ? yu - ching ? and that 's ok . professor d : yeah . if if if if someone says , uh , `` what what is jose doing ? `` and then jose says something , you need to know that that was jose responding . postdoc e : well , people are very flexible . you know ? i mean , so when we did this las last week , i felt that you know , now , andreas may , uh , @ @ { comment } uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . professor d : and so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says `` speaker - five `` there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is jose , grad b : you know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . postdoc e : for a bunch of reasons , legal . professor d : oh i see . i see . grad b : did you read the paper on eurospeech ? phd a : what did it sound like ? professor d : oh , well that 's there 's an easy way to do that . jus - jus just play it all backwards . grad b : uh ok , we 'll quickly do digits . </s>
<s> what did the team say about interaction of data participants with their data ? </s> grad b : now we 're on and it seems to be working . phd a : it 's like when it 's been sitting for a long time or something . postdoc e : ok . do n't know . professor d : so uh so the uh , the new procedural change that just got suggested , which i think is a good idea is that um , we do the digit recordings at the end . and that way , if we 're recording somebody else 's uh meeting , and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and do n't have the time , uh , then they can run off . it 'll mean we 'll get somewhat fewer uh , sets of digits , but um , i think that way we 'll cut into people 's time , um , if someone 's on strict time uh , less . so , i th i think i think we should start doing that . um , so , uh , let 's see , we were having a discussion the other day , maybe we should bring that up , about uh , the nature of the data that we are collecting . uh @ @ that uh , we should have a fair amount of data that is um , collected for the same meeting , so that we can , uh i do n't know . wh - what what were some of the points again about that ? is it phd f : um , at the previous at last week 's meeting , this meeting i was griping about wanting to get more data and i i talked about this with jane and adam , um , and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um , since we 'll have a new this new student di does wan na work with us , and he 's already funded part - time , so we 'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part - time , uh yeah . grad b : mm - hmm . great . phd f : so he 's just getting his feet wet in that . anyway , i thought ok , maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he 'd be starting in january , next semester that we 'd have , you know , enough data to work with . but , um , jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want , and so forth . so , i thought about that and i think it 's still possible , um , but i 'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about , and hear , then sort of a mish - mosh of a bunch of one one - time grad b : mm - hmm . phd f : um , and then there are some others that menti that morgan mentioned , like the front - end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting . grad b : right . yep . yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly . phd f : so so if that were the case then i think we 'd have enough . grad b : so . mm - hmm . phd f : but basically , for anything where you 're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting { comment } meaning out of the meeting , um , it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we did n't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize , grad b : yeah . phd f : but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries . and then we need a couple that of we do n't wan na just have one group because that might be specific to that particular group , but @ @ three or four different kinds . grad b : yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting . phd c : yeah . phd f : see , i 've never listened to the data for the front - end meeting . grad b : yeah , we we 've only had three . professor d : yeah . phd f : like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same . professor d : now , let l l let me just give you the other side to that cuz i ca because i i do n't disagree with that , but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too . uh , for other kinds of research , particularly the acoustic oriented research , i actually feel the opposite need . i 'd like to have lots of different people . i mean , sure , if we can get more from them , fine , phd f : yeah , i definitely agree with that . postdoc e : can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers . because i think if you just say an and in particular , my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you 'd have so people who 'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh , it would be useful for for purposes you know . professor d : mm - hmm . postdoc e : but you know , i think i 've been i 've i i 've gathered data from undergrads at on campus and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you 'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you 'd have at all . and and the english you 'd have the language models would be really hard to build professor d : well , ok , uh , first place , i i i do n't think we 'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another , i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point cuz i i think that 's what we 're investigating , phd f : it has to be a a pre - existing meeting , like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway . professor d : so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh , and and and uh , senior uh , uh , d and uh , doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here . uh , that 's the first point . the second point is um i think that for some time now , going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we 've worked with who had non - native accents and i th i think that grad b : well , i think that , um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english . and and i think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in english , { comment } i i think it 's probably ok if a few of the people do n't have uh , g particularly good english skills . postdoc e : ok , now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective which is that um , there 's there 's this this issue , you have a corpus out there , it should be used for for multiple things cuz it 's so expensive to put together . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . well , that 's pretty much what you 're going to have in the networking group . postdoc e : well oh . but the thing is , i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that so y so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky 's model , an and do some top - down stuff , it to help th the bottom - up and merge the things or whatever , uh , it seems like um , i do n't see that there 's an argument i 'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus , since it 's so expensive to put together , uh , useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are , you know , used in computational linguistics . professor d : ok , well , i i let 's let 's see what we can get . i mean , it it i think that if we 're aiming at at uh , groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together , and it 's from the berkeley campus , probably most of it will be ok , postdoc e : yes , that 's fine . that 's fine . exactly . and my point in m in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iff iffy population . phd f : i definitely agree with that , i mean , for this purpose . grad b : well , not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one . postdoc e : grads and professors , fine . grad b : what 's that ? well , age - ist . { comment } the `` eighteen `` is because of the consent form . phd c : `` age - ist `` . yeah . yeah . grad b : i think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that . we 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this . phd f : right , but right . but if there were such a i mean it 's a remote possibility , then um , you know , one of us could you know , go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here . professor d : well , the other thing yeah , i mean the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around . grad b : yeah , i think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting . phd c : but i i i think you need , uh , another portable thing a another portable equipment to to do , eh , more e easier the recording process , eh , out from icsi . oh - yeah . ye - yeah , yeah . grad b : but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting . professor d : actually , that 's a int that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that 's maybe worth repeating . we realized that , um , when we were talking about this that , ok , there 's these different things that we want to do with it . so , um , it 's true that we wan na be selective in some ways , uh , the way that you were speaking about with , uh , not having an interlingua and uh , these other issues . but on the other hand , it 's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it . so , a a as per the example that we wan na have a fair amount that 's done with a small n recorded with a small , uh , typ number of types of meetings but we can also have another part that 's , uh , just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them and that 's ok too . uh , i we realized in discussion that the other thing is , what about this business of distant and close microphones ? i mean , we really wan na have a substantial amount recorded this way , that 's why we did it . but what about for th for these issues of summarization , a lot of these higher level things you do n't really need the distant microphone . phd f : yea - yeah yeah , you actually do n't really even need any fancy microphone . professor d : you d you do n't ne it does n't you just need some microphone , somewhere . grad b : ye - yeah . yep . phd f : you can use found data . use um , but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect , you know , each person who 's interested in i mean , we have a cou we have a bunch of different , um , slants and perspectives on what it 's useful for , um , they need to be taking charge of making sure they 're getting enough of the kind of data that they want . and so in my case , um , i think there w there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others . and so i 'm looking and thinking , `` well i 'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it 's to help th in my interest . `` professor d : but i think that i 'm raising that cuz i think it 's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about , `` well , gee , we have this really complicated setup to do , `` well maybe you do n't . i mean , we we could have a fairly we could just get a dat machine and phd f : but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this . there 's lots of cues you 're not gon na have . so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information , which is really what makes this corpus powerful . professor d : uh but i i think that the uh i we ca n't really underestimate the difficulty should n't really u underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up . and so , uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say , `` oh , we 'll just do it up there , `` if you 're talking about something simple , where you throw away a lot of these dimensions , then you can do that right away . talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here , it wo n't happen quickly , it wo n't be easy , and there 's all sorts of issues about th you know keeping the equipment safe , or else hauling it around , and all sorts of o i think the first priority should be to pry { comment } to get try to get people to come here . postdoc e : i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea . phd f : yeah , i and i think we can get people to come here , that but the issue is you definitely wan na make sure that the kind of group you 're getting is the right group so that you do n't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down . grad b : um , i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered . and they 'll say there 's no such thing . it 'd be fun . i think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know . phd a : what if you could tell them that you 'll give them the the transcripts when they come back ? phd f : but we might need a little more to incentivize them , { comment } that 's all . grad b : oh , yeah . i mean , anyone can have the transcripts . so . i thought we could point that out . and it 'll take another eleven to do the clone . professor d : sk - it 's copying from one place on abbott to another place on abbott ? phd a : oh , on the tape . postdoc e : yeah , that 's a good point . grad b : and so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something . postdoc e : wow . wow . grad b : well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from andatico for years , according to dave , and andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices . phd a : mm - hmm . hmm . i 've been looking at the , uh , aurora data and , um , first first look at it , there were basically three directories on there that could be moved . one was called aurora , one was spanish , which was carmen 's spanish stuff , and the other one was , um , spine . and so , um , i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk . so , um , i realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the cd - rom type data , the the static data . so i moved that , and then um , i asked him to check out and see if it was ok . before i actually deleted the old stuff , um , but i have n't heard back yet . i told him he could delete it if he wanted to , i have n't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not . and then carmen 's stuff , i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to xa , i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data . and so , i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data . and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk . and then i lo have n't done any of the aurora stuff . i have to meet with , uh , stephane to do that . so . professor d : so , but , uh y you 're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you 're clearing up from the broadcast news , but , we have some other disks , some of which you 're using for aurora , but are we g do we have some other other space now ? grad b : i just do n't remember , it might be dc . and that has enough for about four more meetings right now . yeah , i mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons i do n't understand . phd a : so should , um one question i had for you was , um , we need we sh probably should move the aurora an and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk . is there another backed - up disk that you know of that would ? grad b : we should put it onto the broadcast news one . that 's probably the best thing to do . and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out . phd a : ok . right . right . do you know what happen to know what disk that is off ? ok . postdoc e : i 'm glad to hear it . glad to hear it . grad b : mm - hmm . oh , you did that by hand ? phd c : my my idea is to work grad b : mm - hmm . yes , absolutely . and so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ? phd c : sorry ? no , i i plan to do that . grad b : ok . darn ! professor d : mm - hmm . phd c : the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones . the idea is to eh to use eh , i 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech . and my idea is eh , it would be interesting to to have eh , a control set . and my control set eh , will be the eh , silence , silence without eh , any any noise . professor d : mm - hmm . postdoc e : yeah . { comment } that 's interesting . this is like a ground level , with it 's not it 's not total silence . phd c : eh , i i mean eh , noise eh , eh claps eh , tape clips , eh , the difference eh , professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : these will be assigned by hand ? grad b : well , training , and validation . sure . mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . grad b : one or two or more . phd c : one , two , three . but no , by th by the moment n yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah . yeah , be yeah . `` why ? why ? what 's the reason ? `` because i it 's the first study . the first postdoc e : yeah cuz you 've talked about other overlapping events in the past . so it 's like a signal - noise situation . yeah . well , we needed to get the categories , yeah . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad b : bad . right . but , you know , as a feature , it might be ok . so , we do n't know . supervised clustering . mm - hmm . postdoc e : mm - hmm . grad b : mm - hmm . phd c : is yeah ? w with a model , is is only to cluster using a eh , @ @ or a similarity . postdoc e : mm - hmm . phd c : but eh if you use a neural net is is a good idea , but eh you do n't know what happened in the interior of the neural net . professor d : ok ? like like c - one , c - two , something like that , so that you can visualize it . but i think this is a good place to start . but do n't uh anyway , this is my suggestion , is do n't just , you know , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even even if it 's k - nearest - neighbors , you still wo n't know phd c : yeah . professor d : um so . phd c : yeah . s postdoc e : can i ask ? it strikes me that there 's another piece of information um , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition . so , w if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech , there 's gon na be a b a big informative area there , it seems to me . mm - hmm . professor d : mm - hmm . phd c : eh , because it 's a a great project . but eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh i think you eh we have eh two main eh objective . one one of these is to eh to detect the change , the acoustic change . and for that , if you do n't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , i think the ike criterion or bic criterion eh will be enough to detect the change . professor d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok , but , i i think in any event we 're agreed that the first step is so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps . you wo n't be able to look at it . all you 'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does . phd c : yeah . yeah . yeah . grad b : it would be interesting in itself to see . well , i think that would be an interesting result . professor d : and so , if you can get @ @ { comment } uh again , my prescription would be that you would , with a mixed signal , you would take a collection of possible uh , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , { comment } and then collect , uh in pairs , and then collect ten of them or something , and then proceed with a bigger classifier . and then if you can get that to work well , then you go to the other signal . and then , and you and you know , they wo n't work as well , but how m you know , how much grad b : yeah . but it i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both . because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed , and and do n't phd c : but eh what is the the the relation of eh of the performance when eh you use eh the , eh eh speech file the pda speech files . but it i i i i think it will be important . because eh people eh eh , different groups eh has eh experience with this eh kind of problem . is eh is not easy eh to to solve , because if you i i i have seen the the the speech file from eh pda , and s some parts is { comment } very difficult because you you do n't see the spectrum the spectrogram . grad b : right . yeah , they 're totally hidden . professor d : yeah . yeah . well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable . grad b : are probably better , yep . phd a : yeah , i maybe this is a dumb question , but w i thought it would be i thought it would be easier if you used a pda professor d : uh , well , no , i mean , we we do n't have any rules , r really . uh , if , on the other hand , we show that there 's a huge advantage with two , well then that could be a real point . phd a : well , it 's postdoc e : oh yeah ! oh i agree ! and we use it ourselves . phd a : ok . ok . postdoc e : it seems like that would be pretty strong . professor d : so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just do n't have enough , uh , experience with it to know how postdoc e : yeah . ok . yeah yeah , ok . yeah . oh i 'm not i 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . i just wanted to point out that that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody . professor d : yeah . mm - hmm . grad b : and i think dan is still working on it . so . he actually he wrote me about it a little bit , so . postdoc e : great . no , i do n't mean to discourage that at all . phd c : it will be more interesting to study the pzm because the the the separation i i think professor d : but but but the thing is , uh , one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a pda . phd a : that 's what i was asking about , what are the constraints ? professor d : but , the reason why i have n't focused on that as the fir my first concern is because um , i 'm interested in what happens for people , random people out in some random place where they 're p having an impromptu discussion . and you ca n't just always go , `` well , let 's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se to set up `` . phd a : no , what you need to do is you 'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall . it has all these mikes and it has a plug - in jack to the pda . professor d : the other thing actually , that gets at this a little bit of something else i 'd like to do , is what happens if you have two p d yeah . um , i i i i i would actually kind of like us to wind it down , see if we can still get to the end of the , uh , birthdays thing there . grad b : well , i had a couple things that i did wan na bring out . so we may wan na have everyone sign the new form . postdoc e : if if we 're about to wind down , i think what i would prefer is that we uh , delay the anonymization thing till next week , and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps . i 'd oh , i 'd prefer to have more time for my results . e could i do that next week maybe ? professor d : ok . oh , yeah . sure . grad b : alright . we 're we 're just we 're getting enough data now that i 'd sort of like to do it now , before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it postdoc e : well , ok . now , in terms of like the transcript , the question becomes what symbol are you gon na put in there for everybody 's name , and whether you 're gon na put it in the text where he says `` hey roger `` or are we gon na put that person 's anonymized name in instead ? grad b : we do n't we wan na we ha we want the transcript to be `` roger `` . oh . ugh ! that 's a good point . postdoc e : now , if you want to , you know , i mean , in some cases , i i i know that susan ervin - tripp in some of hers , uh , actually did do uh , um , a filter of the s signal where the person 's name was mentioned , except professor d : yeah yeah , once you get to the publication you can certainly do that . grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc e : now , there , the human subjects committee is very precise . you do n't wan na mention subjects by name in published reports . now , it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study , and just change everybody 's name for the purpose of the publication . and someone who looked yeah , and and in the form that they sign , it does say `` your first name may arise in the course of the meetings `` . s i you know , `` you raised the point , so - and - so `` , it 's be kind of nice to be able to know who `` you `` was . and ac { comment } and actually you remember furthermore , you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know , i was sort of avoiding mentioning people 's names , professor d : yeah , i was too . yeah . postdoc e : and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial . well , i mean , if we 're going to step in after the fact and change people 's names in the transcript , we 've basically done something one step worse . grad b : but that 's because i 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so i think that 's a really good point . you 're right , this is going to require more thought . professor d : yeah . l let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the , uh , what we 're covering in the meeting . uh i realize when you 're doing this that uh i mean , i did n't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about . uh , and so , uh and so i was proceeding some somewhat at random , frankly . so i think what would be helpful would be uh , i and i 'll i 'll mention this to to liz and andreas too , that um , before the meeting if anybody could send me , any any , uh , uh , agenda items that they were interested in and i 'll i 'll take the role of organizing them uh , into into the agenda , postdoc e : ok . sure . professor d : but i 'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda . i 've no desire to to make it up , but if if no one 's told me things , then i 'm just proceeding from my my guesses , and and uh , and i ye yeah , i i 'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean , i 'm just always asking jose what he 's doing , you know , and and so it 's there 's uh , there 's obviously other things going on . grad b : mm - hmm . postdoc e : how do you mean , who what they 're who they 're talking about ? grad b : i mean , so if i 'm saying in a meeting , `` oh and bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so `` , postdoc e : they wo n't be able to change it themselves . grad b : well , the current one they do n't do speaker identity . professor d : so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words . uh yu - ching , yu - ching . yeah . and the next time it 'll be speaker - three even if it 's actually speaker - one . postdoc e : you know uh - huh . you know , that would be a very practical solution on their part . phd c : yeah . it 's a good idea . postdoc e : well , people are very flexible . you know ? i mean , so when we did this las last week , i felt that you know , now , andreas may , uh , @ @ { comment } uh , he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something , and and because he missed something , then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about , and was was unable to do the tracking . professor d : and so , if we pass out the data to someone else , and it says `` speaker - five `` there , we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker - five is jose , grad b : you know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release . postdoc e : i think that 's risky . i think that the public should be the same . i think that when we do that world release , it should be the same . for a bunch of reasons , legal . professor d : i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort , and postdoc e : but i also think a consistent licensing policy is important . phd a : well , one thing to to take into consideration is w are there any um for example , the people who are funding this work , they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse . postdoc e : yeah , we should just market it to non - english speaking countries . grad b : yeah . did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables ? they were di they they had the utterances . and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards . people had no difficulty in interpreting it . so what we need is something that 's the reverse , that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people ca n't understand it . professor d : oh , well that 's there 's an easy way to do that . jus - jus just play it all backwards . </s>
<s> summarize the meeting </s> grad f : wh - what causes the crash ? phd a : did you fix something ? phd e : channel i decided to talk about that . professor b : yes , ok . ok . so uh i also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail i think from uh from ogi and we 'll go go through them also . so where are we on on uh our runs ? phd d : uh so . uh we so as i was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . uh , and we focused for the the test part on the english and the italian . um . we 've trained uh several neural networks on so on the ti - digits english and on the italian data and also on the broad uh english uh french and uh spanish databases . mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well . grad f : oh wait wait wait wait wait . wait . professor b : ok . so um , you were saying about the training data yeah . phd d : yeah , so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem works pretty well . and uh actually we have uh , results are similar only on , phd a : do you mean if it 's trained only on on data from just that task , phd d : just that task . but actually we did n't train network on uh both types of data i mean uh phonetically ba phonetically balanced uh data and task data . professor b : no , no , no . different lang so um if you train on ti - digits and test on italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . phd d : but yeah but i did not uh do that . professor b : so i 'm just imagining . e so , you did n't train on timit and test on on italian digits , say ? phd d : yeah and the fourth test is uh excluding from these three languages the language that is the task language . professor b : oh , ok , yeah , so , that is what i wanted to know . phd d : so this is not so bad . and then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . professor b : ab - about how much ? phd d : so . yeah . professor b : twenty percent further ? phd d : twenty to to thirty percent further . yeah . phd a : so it 's the combination of two things there . it 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages . phd d : and we lose professor b : i i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline , you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task , and something like one point three for three three languages broad stuff . phd d : tas - task data we are u yeah . professor b : but uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent . so i was just i just trying to understand that . so if we call a factor of w just one , just normalized to one , the word error rate that you have for using ti - digits as as training and ti - digits as test , but but uh , uh the same task and so on . phd a : one point four ? phd d : what would you say ? around one point four phd a : task data . professor b : wait a minute , th th the so is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case ? grad f : yeah , a fraction of it . professor b : and the broad english data is what you got this one point one with . so that 's timit basically right ? so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? um and um but , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the ti - digits . ok , now all of this is this is noisy ti - digits , i assume ? both training and test ? phd d : so . this was for the plp , professor b : i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be grad f : um , but he mm - hmm . phd a : mm - hmm . i wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? this multi - language uh labelling ? ok , ok . so this would from this you would say , `` well , it does n't really matter if we put finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gon na be , you know , finnish in the test data . `` right ? professor b : well , it 's it sounds i mean , we have to be careful , cuz we have n't gotten a good result yet . we 've never just trained on one lang phd d : uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? professor b : so , i mean wha what 's the this this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for ti - digits , or ? phd d : so . it 's it 's the htk results , i mean . so it 's htk training testings with different kind of features so . uh yeah . it 's uh the one hundred number . it 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline . yeah . so , seventy point two means that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent . professor b : ok , so if we take uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data in in what ? phd a : ok so these are not ok , alright , i see . i see . professor b : uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line . phd e : fifty - one ? this phd d : so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . yeah . there were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . so , the recursion uh part . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , phd d : no , i we plan to start this uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these what we could do more as a as a research and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not uh , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the networks if we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , yeah but , we know that ye - yeah but here it 's something different . we want to have features yeah , but mmm , i mean , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . professor b : almost . but i mean it it it does give a distribution . phd d : yeah . yeah , sure but uh so basically it 's almost binary decisions and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh professor b : but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it and and we 'll see . but but what i 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know , what do we do in four or five days ? uh , and so we have to be concerned with are we gon na look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . so what i what is going on right now ? what 's right you 've got nets retraining , are there is there are there any h t k trainings testings going on ? phd e : i do n't know . phd d : uh so there is this combination , yeah . working on combination obviously . um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . grad f : twenty - seven . professor b : uh . the software currently just has uh a allows for i think , the one one hot output . so you 're having multiple nets and combining them , or ? uh , how are you how are you coming up with if you say uh if you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic , how do you phd a : i think they have one output . professor b : oh , it 's just one net . phd d : it 's one net with um twenty - seven outputs if we have twenty - seven classes , yeah , one single kl to transform everything professor b : so i think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , so we can get uh key key questions answered uh before then were there other things that you wanted to phd e : we have one . professor b : ok , so um , something i asked so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , i believe . um i asked uh hynek whether i have n't talked to sunil i asked hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities . phd e : but they have a question of the result . um how are trained the the lda filter ? how obtained the lda filter ? yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . i do n't understand also professor b : it says `` baseline asp `` . phd c : well , it says baseline asp is twenty - three mill minus thirteen . from the baseline . { comment } ok . phd d : i think i think it 's the c - zero using c - zero instead of log energy . yeah , it 's this . phd a : does does anybody know how they 're using it ? professor b : yeah . so so what they 're doing here is , i right ? so um so it 's throwing out frames and the thing is um , what i do n't understand is how they 're doing this with h t phd d : yeah . yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . professor b : yeah . yeah , so i mean in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gon na decode from here to here . phd a : in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . so that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . plus it 's gon na introduce delays . professor b : and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? and it did n't so badly , right ? so they did something . computation ? grad f : it just died . grad g : do we do we have that big new ibm machine the , i think in th professor b : we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , uh ibm was donating five , i think we only got two so far , processors . we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . they ended up being five fifty . so instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . so i do n't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , but uh hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and uh , yeah , i think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . i mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . and uh and uh a nice amount of memory . uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast linux machine . grad g : and if we can do things on linux , some of the machines we have going already , like swede ? professor b : yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . i mean , it it 's i think the machine is just sitting there . and it does have two processors , you know and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . and i mean i it 's possible that the i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight . there 's there 's there 's gon na be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . but . notice how i said somebody and turned my head your direction . that 's one thing you do n't get in these recordings . you do n't get the do n't get the visuals but grad g : because , um i think that 'll be running linux , and sw - swede and fudge are already running linux so , um i could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the htk stuff running under linux , and to start with i 'm wondering which one i should pick first . professor b : for yeah . for the aurora ? ok . well , i do n't know how we can i do n't know how to do we have htk source ? is that yeah . phd a : they have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in h t and you can parallelize the training . and it just basically keeps counts . and there 's something a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together . professor b : i see . phd a : i do n't what their scripts are set up to do for the aurora stuff , but </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about the effect of training on different languages </s> phd e : ok . i saw that . ah yeah , it 's ok . channel i decided to talk about that . professor b : yes , ok . ok . so uh i also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail i think from uh from ogi and we 'll go go through them also . so where are we on on uh our runs ? phd d : uh so . uh we so as i was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . professor b : excuse me . phd d : uh , and we focused for the the test part on the english and the italian . um . we 've trained uh several neural networks on so on the ti - digits english and on the italian data and also on the broad uh english uh french and uh spanish databases . mmm , so there 's our result tables here , for the tandem approach , and um , actually what we we @ @ observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it works pretty well . just that task . but actually we did n't train network on uh both types of data i mean uh phonetically ba phonetically balanced uh data and task data . professor b : but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ? i mean , my assump from what i saw from the earlier results , uh i guess last week , was that um , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . but but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ? phd d : we no , we did four four kind of of testing , actually . the first testing is with task data so , with nets trained on task data . so for italian on the italian speech @ @ . the second test is trained on a single language um with broad database , but the same language as the t task data . professor b : it has three languages . that 's including the w the the phd a : it 's multilingual . phd d : yeah . the only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual um professor b : so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? yeah . ok . um ok . well . we we we may just need to uh so i mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task did n't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language um it does n't seem to matter the difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . it sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language or i mean . you have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you have n't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set . that that could be . um so , what about so these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh phd d : uh , let me check . uh . professor b : i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be phd d : yeah , yeah . ok . professor b : uh uh , i 'll i 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it , too . phd a : that 's where he removed english , grad f : it sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using . professor b : i mean . that 's interesting because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh did n't have so much representation of english , because in the other case you do n't get hurt any more , at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , phd a : mm - hmm . i wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? this multi - language uh labelling ? grad f : he was using uh sixty - four phonemes from sampa . phd a : so this would from this you would say , `` well , it does n't really matter if we put finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gon na be , you know , finnish in the test data . `` right ? professor b : well , it 's it sounds i mean , we have to be careful , cuz we have n't gotten a good result yet . and comparing different bad results can be tricky . but i i i i think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech . it 's it 's um but we did oh yeah , the other thing i was asking him , though , is that i think that in the case yeah , you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . i think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you did n't have three , but you just had one language . so you trained on one type of digits and tested on another . didn - was n't there something of that ? where you , say , trained on spanish and tested on on ti - digits , or the other way around ? something like that ? um , this may have been what i was asking before , stephane , but but , um , was n't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? i mean no no mixture but just phd d : uh , no , no . so the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and { comment } that professor b : but we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . right ? i mean , you have n't you have n't done all your tests on multiple languages . phd d : uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? phd a : ok , ok , gotcha . professor b : um and `` multi - english `` refers to what ? phd d : to timit . mmm . then you have uh mf , ms and me which are for french , spanish and english . and , yeah . actually i i uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers . mmm . and we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we do n't use delta but it 's not not that much . professor b : right . so w w so , i 'm sorry . i missed that . what 's mf , ms and me ? ok so i think what i 'm what i saw in your smaller chart that i was thinking of was was there were some numbers i saw , i think , that included these multiple languages and it and i was seeing that it got worse . i i think that was all it was . you had some very limited results that at that point which showed having in these these other languages . in fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where english was removed . so that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor . what i we had n't seen yet was that if you added in the english , it 's still poor . uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data well , i think this is what you were explaining . the noise condition is the same it 's the same uh aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training . phd d : yeah . but it 's not a clean case . it 's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same . phd a : uh that 's still noisy ? ah , ok . professor b : ok ? um so uh , i think this will take some looking at , thinking about . but , what is uh what is currently running , that 's uh , i that just filling in the holes here or or ? { comment } pretty much ? phd d : but actually there is something important , is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to htk . um mmm . so basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for italian uh with straight mmm , plp features using on - line normalization . mmm . and the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the plp twelve on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and uh forty - two are the results obtained by uh pratibha with uh his on - line normalization uh her on - line normalization approach . so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . yeah . there were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . so , the recursion uh part . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . um , but , yeah . i assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . it was true on uh ti - digits but it 's not true on italian . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used c - zero instead of log energy . uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much because i think the neural networks learn perhaps to even if the features are not normalized . it it will learn how to normalize and no , i we plan to start this uh so , act actually we have discussed uh @ @ um , these what we could do more as a as a research and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not uh , well , there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the networks if we trained the networks on the on a language and a t or a specific task , and uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . but the way the feature gives the the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data . professor b : it 's a trade - off , right ? any - anyway go ahead . phd d : yeah . so uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks . doing something like , um um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes . professor b : maybe . i mean , i i think you could make the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . right . and in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . right ? phd d : ye - yeah but here it 's something different . we want to have features uh well , um . professor b : yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context . ok ? but i it 's it 's a big deal to get that . i i 'm i 'm sort of and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . so um uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data um phd d : yeah , but mmm , i mean , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . and uh binary decisions about phonemes . nnn uh it 's mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . phd d : um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . um . and we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network . um , so , get simpler networks , because we still have the features . so we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic categories . and we have basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes . well , something using place of articulation which which leads to nine , i think , broad classes . uh , another which is based on manner , which is is also something like nine classes . and then , something that combine both , and we have twenty f twenty - five ? twenty - seven broad classes . so like , uh , oh , i do n't know , like back vowels , front vowels . but yeah , because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings , and ogi show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . i mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after . so this is one thing and but perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information . uh . professor b : and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace , uh uh , it 's it 's really time to time to choose . um , let me pass this out , by the way . um these are did did did i interrupt you ? so um their uh the results look pretty good . um , i mean , not uniformly . phd e : yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . professor b : and it 's this is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . phd a : in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . so that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . professor b : um . but it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's i i certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot . it does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . and then it 'd be ok . they they clearly did actually remove silent sections in order because they got these word error rate results . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , i do n't know . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . so it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . so this might just be a temporary thing . but but , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . so um the question we 're gon na wan na go through next week when hynek shows up i guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at uh , by then i guess , combinations of features and multi - band uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . and they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . but they 've been looking at uh at these issues . at the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . and i guess when he comes here we 're gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at and once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ? uh , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got uh another month or so , i mean there 's holidays in the way , but but uh i think the evaluation data comes january thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . well , see they , i i think they 're um . i do n't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it . they 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , i believe . phd a : oh , right . maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ? professor b : so . uh . uh , you know that 's what i had thought . but i do n't i do n't think they are . most recognizers do n't like zeros but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand phd a : yeah . professor b : sorry epsilon random variable in or something . phd a : some constant vector . i mean i w or something that 's right . but something that what i mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech . professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : so that the the silence model in htk will always pick it up . professor b : but whatever they did , i mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . phd a : yeah . cuz you got ta do something . otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together professor b : no they 're phd a : yeah . yeah , right . professor b : and it did n't so badly , right ? so they did something . phd a : yeah , yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : uh , just have a bigger hidden layer . uh but i doubt it would help by forty per cent . but but uh phd d : hmm . { comment } mm - hmm . professor b : uh but it wo n't be installed for a little while . phd c : tonic . professor b : u go ahead . we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , uh ibm was donating five , i think we only got two so far , processors . we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . they ended up being five fifty . so instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . so i do n't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , but uh hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and uh , yeah , i think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . i mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . and uh and uh a nice amount of memory . uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast linux machine . mm - hmm . grad g : um it seems pretty fast . professor b : mm - hmm . grad g : but i think fudge is pretty fast too . i is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the htk runs that are slowing us down ? because , um i think that 'll be running linux , and sw - swede and fudge are already running linux so , um i could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the htk stuff running under linux , and to start with i 'm wondering which one i should pick first . phd a : they have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in h t and you can parallelize the training . i do n't what their scripts are set up to do for the aurora stuff , but </s>
<s> what did phd d explain about the multilingual model ? </s> professor b : oh , i 'm channel must be channel one . channel one ? phd d : uh so . uh we so as i was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . professor b : but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ? i mean , my assump from what i saw from the earlier results , uh i guess last week , was that um , if you trained on one language and tested on another , say , that the results were were relatively poor . but but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ? no , no , no . different lang so um if you train on ti - digits and test on italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . so i 'm just imagining . e so , you did n't train on timit and test on on italian digits , say ? phd d : but for italian we choose spanish which we assume is close to italian . the third test is by using , um the three language database professor b : it has three languages . that 's including the w the the phd a : so it 's the combination of two things there . it 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages . it 's multilingual . phd d : yeah . the only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual um professor b : so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? um and um but , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the ti - digits . ok , now all of this is this is noisy ti - digits , i assume ? both training and test ? yeah . ok . um ok . well . we we we may just need to uh so i mean it 's interesting that h going to a different different task did n't seem to hurt us that much , and going to a different language um it does n't seem to matter the difference between three and four is not particularly great , so that means that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal . it sounds like um uh we may need to have more of uh things that are similar to a target language or i mean . you have the same number of parameters in the neural net , you have n't increased the size of the neural net , and maybe there 's just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set . that that could be . um so , what about so these are results with uh th that you 're describing now , that they are pretty similar for the different features or or uh phd d : um . the yeah . for the plp with jrasta the the we this is quite the same tendency , with a slight increase of the error rate , uh if we go to to timit . and then it 's it gets worse with the multilingual . um . yeah . there there is a difference actually with b between plp and jrasta is that jrasta seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition . mmm . professor b : i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be phd d : yeah , yeah . ok . professor b : uh uh , i 'll i 'll sing a song or dance or something while you do it , too . phd a : the um what was was this number forty or it was roughly the same as this one , he said ? when you had the two language versus the three language ? grad f : it sometimes , actually , depends on what features you 're using . professor b : yeah . but but i it sounds like grad f : um , but he mm - hmm . professor b : i mean . that 's interesting because it it seems like what it 's saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh did n't have so much representation of english , because in the other case you do n't get hurt any more , at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse , phd a : mm - hmm . i wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? this multi - language uh labelling ? grad f : he was using uh sixty - four phonemes from sampa . phd a : so this would from this you would say , `` well , it does n't really matter if we put finnish into the training of the neural net , if there 's gon na be , you know , finnish in the test data . `` right ? professor b : but i i i i think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech . it 's it 's um but we did oh yeah , the other thing i was asking him , though , is that i think that in the case yeah , you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . i think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you did n't have three , but you just had one language . so you trained on one type of digits and tested on another . didn - was n't there something of that ? where you , say , trained on spanish and tested on on ti - digits , or the other way around ? something like that ? um , this may have been what i was asking before , stephane , but but , um , was n't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? i mean no no mixture but just phd d : so the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and { comment } that uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? professor b : see , i thought you showed me something like that last week . you had a you had a little this this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for ti - digits , or ? phd d : the upper part is for ti - digits phd a : so , so the upper part is training ti - digits ? professor b : uh um let 's see plp uh with on - line normalization and delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column , um and `` multi - english `` refers to what ? phd d : to timit . mmm . then you have uh mf , ms and me which are for french , spanish and english . and , yeah . actually i i uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers . mmm . and we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we do n't use delta but it 's not not that much . phd a : multi - french , multi - spanish phd d : so . multi - french , multi - spanish , and multi - english . professor b : ok so i think what i 'm what i saw in your smaller chart that i was thinking of was was there were some numbers i saw , i think , that included these multiple languages and it and i was seeing that it got worse . i i think that was all it was . you had some very limited results that at that point which showed having in these these other languages . in fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where english was removed . so that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor . what i we had n't seen yet was that if you added in the english , it 's still poor . uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data well , i think this is what you were explaining . the noise condition is the same it 's the same uh aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training . phd d : yeah . at least at least for the first for the well - matched , professor b : well , i mean , let 's see . is there any difference in so it 's in the uh so you 're saying that when you train on english and uh and and test on phd d : there there is another difference , is that the noise the noises are different . yeah . but it 's not a clean case . it 's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same . but actually there is something important , is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to htk . um mmm . so basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for italian uh with straight mmm , plp features using on - line normalization . mmm . and the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the plp twelve on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and uh forty - two are the results obtained by uh pratibha with uh his on - line normalization uh her on - line normalization approach . just uh yeah . so these are the results of ogi with on - line normalization and straight features to htk . and the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to htk . professor b : so , do you know what was wrong with the on - line normalization , or ? phd d : yeah . there were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . so , the recursion uh part . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . so it adapts more quickly um , but , yeah . i assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . it was true on uh ti - digits but it 's not true on italian . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used c - zero instead of log energy . uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . we it it 's slightly uh different because i do n't exactly initialize the same way she does . actually i start , mmm , i do n't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion . i i use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five twenty - fifth frame . but , well it 's similar . so uh i retrained the networks with these well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much even if the features are not normalized . it it will learn how to normalize and professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , phd d : and uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . but the way the feature gives the the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data . professor b : it 's a trade - off , phd d : yeah . so uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks . doing something like , um um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes . professor b : maybe . i mean , i i think you could make the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . right . and in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . right ? phd d : ye - yeah but here it 's something different . we want to have features professor b : yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context . uh , and you 're putting it all together , ignoring the differences in context . that that 's true for the hybrid system , it 's true for a tandem system . so , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . ok ? but i it 's it 's a big deal to get that . i i 'm i 'm sort of and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . so um uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data um phd d : and uh binary decisions about phonemes . nnn uh it 's professor b : oh no , but it would still be even more of a binary decision . it it 'd be even more of one . because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one , but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero . phd d : mmm . mm - hmm . mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh posteriors vector um which means that but still the information is relevant because it 's it 's information that helps to discriminate , if it 's possible to be able to discriminate among the phonemes in context . professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it phd d : um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . um . and we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network . um , so , get simpler networks , because we still have the features . so we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic categories . and we have basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes . well , something using place of articulation which which leads to nine , i think , broad classes . uh , another which is based on manner , which is is also something like nine classes . and then , something that combine both , and we have twenty f twenty - five ? twenty - seven broad classes . so like , uh , oh , i do n't know , like back vowels , front vowels . and then mm - hmm . professor b : but you think if you include that plus the other features , phd d : but yeah , because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings , and ogi show showed that , is the distinction between sp speech and silence because these nets are trained on well - controlled condition . i mean the labels are obtained on clean speech , and we add noise after . so this is one thing and but perhaps , something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information . uh . professor b : so so again then we have these broad classes and well , somewhat broad . i mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four , basically . and you have the original features . phd e : and only transform the other i 'm not sure . professor b : ok , so um , something i asked so they 're they 're doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection so again , it 's the silence so they 've just trained up a net which has two outputs , i believe . um i asked uh hynek whether i have n't talked to sunil i asked hynek whether they compared that to just taking the nets we already had and summing up the probabilities . uh . to get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . um and , he did n't think they had , um . but on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you do n't run the other , maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . phd e : yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . and maybe for the italian , for the td te on for finnish , these filter are are obtained with their own training set . professor b : and it 's this is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . if you look down at the block diagram , um , they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it 's speech or silence , you find stretches where the combination of the frame wise vad and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . and then it 's going through and just throwing the data away . it 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . there 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gon na be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . but if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . i think they 're they 're they 're treating it , you know , like uh well , it 's not isolated word , but but connected , you know , the the well . no they they have numbers though , right ? so i think they 're they 're doing something like that . i think that they 're they 're i think what i mean by tha that is they 're trying to come up with a block diagram that 's plausible for the standard . in other words , it 's uh i mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bits you have to transmit it 's not a bad idea to detect silence anyway . um . but it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's i i certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot . it does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? so um . the temporal lda does in fact include the same so that i think he well , by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram i think means if you construct it this way , this this delay would work in that way and then it 'd be ok . they they clearly did actually remove silent sections in order because they got these word error rate results . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , i do n't know . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . so it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . so this might just be a temporary thing . but but , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . so um the question we 're gon na wan na go through next week when hynek shows up i guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at uh , by then i guess , combinations of features and multi - band uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . and they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . but they 've been looking at uh at these issues . at the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . and i guess when he comes here we 're gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at and once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ? uh , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got uh another month or so , i mean there 's holidays in the way , but but uh i think the evaluation data comes january thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . well , see they , i i think they 're um . i do n't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it . they 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , i believe . so . uh . uh , you know that 's what i had thought . but i do n't i do n't think they are . i mean that 's sort of what the way i had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . probably do n't want all zeros . most recognizers do n't like zeros but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand sorry epsilon random variable in or something . phd a : that 's right . but something that what i mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech . professor b : mm - hmm . phd a : so that the the silence model in htk will always pick it up . cuz you got ta do something . otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together yeah , yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . hmm . { comment } mm - hmm . grad g : i is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the htk runs that are slowing us down ? professor b : uh , i think yes . uh , is n't that right ? i mean i think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ? if the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still would n't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the htk trainings , you would think that would fairly trivially the training would , anyway , th the testing uh i do n't i do n't think would parallelize all that well . but i think that you could certainly do d um , distributed , sort of ah , no , it 's the each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize . but you could split up the sentences in a test set . </s>
<s> what did the professor think about the use of english ? </s> phd e : ok . i saw that . ah yeah , it 's ok . professor b : oh , i 'm channel must be channel one . channel one ? phd e : channel i decided to talk about that . phd d : uh so . uh we so as i was already said , we we mainly focused on uh four kind of features . professor b : excuse me . but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data ?

professor b : well , it 's it sounds i mean , we have to be careful , cuz we have n't gotten a good result yet . but i i i i think it does suggest that it 's not so much uh uh cross language as cross type of speech . it 's it 's um but we did oh yeah , the other thing i was asking him , though , is that i think that in the case yeah , you you do have to be careful because of com compounded results . i think we got some earlier results in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you did n't have three , but you just had one language . so you trained on one type of digits and tested on another . didn - was n't there something of that ? where you , say , trained on spanish and tested on on ti - digits , or the other way around ? something like that ? um , this may have been what i was asking before , stephane , but but , um , was n't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? i mean no no mixture but just phd d : training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ? so the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and { comment } that professor b : but we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . right ? i mean , you have n't you have n't done all your tests on multiple languages . phd d : uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? phd a : ok , ok , gotcha . professor b : um and `` multi - english `` refers to what ? phd d : to timit . mmm . then you have uh mf , ms and me which are for french , spanish and english . and , yeah . actually i i uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers . mmm . and we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we do n't use delta but it 's not not that much . professor b : right . so w w so , i 'm sorry . i missed that . what 's mf , ms and me ? ok so i think what i 'm what i saw in your smaller chart that i was thinking of was was there were some numbers i saw , i think , that included these multiple languages and it and i was seeing that it got worse . i i think that was all it was . you had some very limited results that at that point which showed having in these these other languages . in fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where english was removed . so that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor . what i we had n't seen yet was that if you added in the english , it 's still poor . uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data well , i think this is what you were explaining . the noise condition is the same it 's the same uh aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training . no , you do n't have training on english testing phd d : yeah . but it 's not a clean case . it 's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same . phd a : uh that 's still noisy ? ah , ok . phd d : so it 's always noisy basically , phd a : i see . phd d : but actually there is something important , is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the on - line normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using was not uh leading to very good results when we used the straight features to htk . um mmm . so basically d if you look at the at the left of the table , the first uh row , with eighty - six , one hundred , and forty - three and seventy - five , these are the results we obtained for italian uh with straight mmm , plp features using on - line normalization . mmm . and the , mmm what 's in the table , just at the left of the plp twelve on - line normalization column , so , the numbers seventy - nine , fifty - four and uh forty - two are the results obtained by uh pratibha with uh his on - line normalization uh her on - line normalization approach . professor b : uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line . phd d : yeah . there were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . so , the recursion uh part . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . so it adapts more quickly um , but , yeah . i assume that this was not important because uh previous results from from dan and show that basically the both both values g give the same same uh results . it was true on uh ti - digits but it 's not true on italian . uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used c - zero instead of log energy . uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much even if the features are not normalized . it it will learn how to normalize and professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , phd d : and uh mmm and ask the network to put one , at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side . and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that 's not correct because if we change task and if the phonemes are not in the same context in the new task , obviously the decision boundaries are not should not be at the same place . but the way the feature gives the the way the network gives the features is that it reduce completely the it removes completely the information a lot of information from the the features by uh uh placing the decision boundaries at optimal places for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data . professor b : it 's a trade - off , right ? any - anyway go ahead . phd d : yeah . so uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks . doing something like , um um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes . professor b : maybe . i mean , i i think you could make the same argument , it 'd be just as legitimate , for hybrid systems as well . right . and in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . right ? phd d : ye - yeah but here it 's something different . we want to have features uh well , um . professor b : yeah , but it 's still true that what you 're doing is you 're ignoring you 're you 're coming up with something to represent , whether it 's a distribution , probability distribution or features , you 're coming up with a set of variables that are representing uh , things that vary w over context . uh , and you 're putting it all together , ignoring the differences in context . that that 's true for the hybrid system , it 's true for a tandem system . so , for that reason , when you in in in a hybrid system , when you incorporate context one way or another , you do get better scores . ok ? but i it 's it 's a big deal to get that . i i 'm i 'm sort of and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . so um uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data um phd d : yeah , but mmm , i mean , the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decisions . and uh binary decisions about phonemes . nnn uh it 's mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . uh , ok . phd d : um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . um . and we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of outputs of the neural network . um , so , get simpler networks , because we still have the features . so we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic categories . and we have basically we have three types of broad phonetic classes . well , something using place of articulation which which leads to nine , i think , broad classes . uh , another which is based on manner , which is is also something like nine classes . and then , something that combine both , and we have twenty f twenty - five ? twenty - seven broad classes . so like , uh , oh , i do n't know , like back vowels , front vowels . professor b : but you think if you include that plus the other features , so so again then we have these broad classes and well , somewhat broad . i mean , it 's twenty - seven instead of sixty - four , basically . and you have the original features . and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace , uh uh , it 's it 's really time to time to choose . um , let me pass this out , by the way . um these are did did did i interrupt you ? uh . to get the speech voice activity detection , or else just using the silence , if there 's only one silence output . um and , he did n't think they had , um . but on the other hand , maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you do n't run the other , maybe there 's a computational advantage to having a separate net , anyway . i i 'm sorry . i do n't understand your question . phd e : yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . professor b : and it 's this is mostly better than baseline , although in some cases it 's a little worse , in a couple cases . but if you say speech starts here , speech ends there . phd a : in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . so that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . professor b : um . but it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's i i certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot . it does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? and then it 'd be ok . they they clearly did actually remove silent sections in order because they got these word error rate results . so um i think that it 's it 's nice to do that in this because in fact , it 's gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation . whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard , i do n't know . um . uh , as you know , part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word models are pretty bad and nobody wants has has approached improving them . so it 's possible that a lot of the problems with so many insertions and so forth would go away if they were better word models to begin with . so this might just be a temporary thing . but but , on the other hand , and maybe maybe it 's a decent idea . so um the question we 're gon na wan na go through next week when hynek shows up i guess is given that we 've been if you look at what we 've been trying , we 're uh looking at uh , by then i guess , combinations of features and multi - band uh , and we 've been looking at cross - language , cross task issues . and they 've been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issues . but they 've been looking at uh at these issues . at the on - line normalization and the uh voice activity detection . and i guess when he comes here we 're gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we 've looked at to um blend with some group of things in what they 've looked at and once we choose that , how do we split up the effort ? uh , because we still have even once we choose , we 've still got uh another month or so , i mean there 's holidays in the way , but but uh i think the evaluation data comes january thirty - first so there 's still a fair amount of time to do things together it 's just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two sites in that that amount of time . well , see they , i i think they 're um . i do n't know the the specifics of how they 're doing it . they 're they 're getting around the way the recognizer works because they 're not allowed to um , change the scripts for the recognizer , i believe . phd a : oh , right . maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ? professor b : so . uh . uh , you know that 's what i had thought . but i do n't i do n't think they are . i mean that 's sort of what the way i had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . probably do n't want all zeros . most recognizers do n't like zeros but but you know , put some epsilon in or some rand phd a : yeah . professor b : sorry epsilon random variable in or something . phd a : some constant vector . i mean i w or something that 's right . but something that what i mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech . so that the the silence model in htk will always pick it up . professor b : but whatever they did , i mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . phd a : yeah . cuz you got ta do something . otherwise , if it 's just a bunch of speech , stuck together yeah . yeah , right . professor b : and it did n't so badly , right ? so they did something . phd a : yeah , yeah . professor b : uh , just have a bigger hidden layer . uh but i doubt it would help by forty per cent . but but uh phd d : hmm . { comment } mm - hmm . professor b : uh but it wo n't be installed for a little while . u go ahead . we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , uh ibm was donating five , i think we only got two so far , processors . we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . they ended up being five fifty . so instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . so i do n't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , but uh hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and uh , yeah , i think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . i mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . and uh and uh a nice amount of memory . uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast linux machine . yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . i mean , it it 's i think the machine is just sitting there . and it does have two processors , you know and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . and i mean i it 's possible that the i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight . there 's there 's there 's gon na be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . but . notice how i said somebody and turned my head your direction . that 's one thing you do n't get in these recordings . you do n't get the do n't get the visuals but grad g : i is it um mostly um the neural network trainings that are um slowing us down or the htk runs that are slowing us down ? phd a : and it just basically keeps counts . and there 's something a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together . professor b : i see . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion on managing the complexity of the model </s> phd a : did you fix something ? phd c : hello , hello . grad f : oh , maybe it 's the turning turning off and turning on of the mike , right ? yep , that 's me . phd e : channel i decided to talk about that . professor b : yes , ok . ok . so uh i also copied uh the results that we all got in the mail i think from uh from ogi and we 'll go go through them also . so where are we on on uh our runs ? excuse me . phd c : yeah , it 's longer . phd d : um yeah . so , but yeah but i did not uh do that . professor b : so i 'm just imagining . e so , you did n't train on timit and test on on italian digits , say ? oh , ok , yeah , so , that is what i wanted to know . phd a : so it 's the combination of two things there . it 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages . so they were sort of building here ? professor b : i i i 'm sorry . phd d : oh yeah , the f yeah , ok . professor b : and if you exclude english , from this combination , what 's that ? that 's interesting . that 's interesting . do you see ? because uh , phd d : yeah . the only difference it 's is that it 's multilingual um uh yeah . grad f : yeah , um . professor b : and the broad english data is what you got this one point one with . so that 's timit basically right ? so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? um and um but , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the ti - digits . ok , now all of this is this is noisy ti - digits , i assume ? both training and test ? i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be phd d : yeah , yeah . ok . professor b : um . that 's what he was saying . phd a : mm - hmm . i wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? this multi - language uh labelling ? ok , ok . yeah , that would be interesting . professor b : um , this may have been what i was asking before , stephane , but but , um , was n't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? i mean no no mixture but just phd d : uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? professor b : so , i mean wha what 's the this this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for ti - digits , or ? phd d : so you have uh basically two uh parts . grad f : yeah , yeah , yeah . phd d : and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this . so . uh yeah . phd a : so where is the baseline for the ti - digits located in here ? ah ! ah , ok , ok . ok , i see . professor b : uh um let 's see plp uh with on - line normalization and delta - del so that 's this thing you have circled here in the second column , phd d : to timit . mmm . then you have uh mf , ms and me which are for french , spanish and english . and , yeah . actually i i uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh features without the s derivatives uh but with increased frame numbers . mmm . and we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it 's slightly slightly worse when we do n't use delta but it 's not not that much . professor b : right . so w w so , i 'm sorry . i missed that . what 's mf , ms and me ? ok so i think what i 'm what i saw in your smaller chart that i was thinking of was was there were some numbers i saw , i think , that included these multiple languages and it and i was seeing that it got worse . i i think that was all it was . you had some very limited results that at that point which showed having in these these other languages . in fact it might have been just this last category , having two languages broad that were where where english was removed . so that was cross language and the and the result was quite poor . what i we had n't seen yet was that if you added in the english , it 's still poor . phd a : ok so these are not ok , alright , i see . uh that 's still noisy ? ah , ok . i see . professor b : uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line . phd a : oh i see , ok . phd d : just uh yeah . so these are the results of ogi with on - line normalization and straight features to htk . and the previous result , eighty - six and so on , are with our features straight to htk . so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . so it adapts more quickly uh , second thing is the initialization of the stuff . actually , uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance . and using initial values that are the global mean and variances measured across the whole database . and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um values of the mean and variance by computing this on the twenty - five first frames of each utterance . mmm . there were other minor differences , the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen , and that she used c - zero instead of log energy . uh , but the main differences concerns the recursion . so . uh , i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that 's similar to the ogi baseline . we it it 's slightly uh different because i do n't exactly initialize the same way she does . actually i start , mmm , i do n't wait to a fifteen twenty - five twenty - five frames before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion . i i use the on - line scheme and only start the re recursion after the twenty - five twenty - fifth frame . but , well it 's similar . so uh i retrained the networks with these well , the the the networks are retaining with these new features . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , phd d : yeah . so uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of outputs of the neural networks . doing something like , um um phonemes within context and , well , basically context dependent phonemes . professor b : and in fact , th things get better with context dependent versions . right ? phd d : uh well , um . yeah . yeah , sure but uh so basically it 's almost binary decisions and um the idea of using more classes is to get something that 's less binary decisions . professor b : uh , i mean for instance , the the thing i was arguing for before , but again which i do n't think we have time to try , is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several outputs on and use articulatory features phd d : mmm . mm - hmm . mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . and and we 'll see . but but what i 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know , what do we do in four or five days ? uh , and so we have to be concerned with are we gon na look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . um , are we going to look at multi - band ? are we gon na look at combinations of things ? uh , what questions are we gon na ask , uh now that , i mean , we should probably turn shortly to this o g i note . um , how are we going to combine with what they 've been focusing on ? uh , uh we have n't been doing any of the l d a rasta sort of thing . so what i what is going on right now ? what 's right you 've got nets retraining , are there is there are there any h t k trainings testings going on ? phd e : i i i 'm trying the htk with eh , plp twelve on - line delta - delta and msg filter together . phd d : uh so there is this combination , yeah . working on combination obviously . um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . phd a : i think they have one output . professor b : i see . i see , ok . uh - huh . but you think if you include that plus the other features , phd e : and only transform the other i 'm not sure . professor b : um , let me pass this out , by the way . um these are did did did i interrupt you ? i i 'm sorry . i do n't understand your question . phd e : yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . phd c : from the baseline . { comment } ok . phd d : i think i think it 's the c - zero using c - zero instead of log energy . phd e : ah , ok , mm - hmm . phd a : they s they say in here that the vad is not used as an additional feature . professor b : yeah . so so what they 're doing here is , i phd a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . so it 's it 's i do n't understand . you mean it 's throwing out frames ? before professor b : it 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . there 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gon na be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . so it 's throwing out frames and the thing is um , what i do n't understand is how they 're doing this with h t it stretches again . for single frames i think it would be pretty hard . phd d : yeah . yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . professor b : yeah . yeah , so i mean in the i i in the in the decoding , you 're saying that we 're gon na decode from here to here . phd a : in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . so that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . yeah . yeah . i 'm just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it was n't this . professor b : right ? and so um and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? ah , thank you . phd a : oh , right . maybe they 're just inserting some nummy frames or something ? professor b : i mean that 's sort of what the way i had imagined would happen is that on the other side , yeah you p put some low level noise or something . probably do n't want all zeros . sorry epsilon random variable in or something . mm - hmm . and it did n't so badly , right ? so they did something . phd d : mm - hmm . um , not much problems with that . grad f : it just died . professor b : ok . yeah , we 're gon na get a replacement server that 'll be a faster server , actually . uh but it wo n't be installed for a little while . phd c : tonic . professor b : we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , uh ibm was donating five , i think we only got two so far , processors . we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . they ended up being five fifty . so instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . so i do n't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , but uh hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and uh , yeah , i think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . i mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . and uh and uh a nice amount of memory . uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast linux machine . grad g : and if we can do things on linux , some of the machines we have going already , like swede ? um it seems pretty fast . professor b : yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . i mean , it it 's i think the machine is just sitting there . and it does have two processors , you know and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . and i mean i it 's possible that the i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight . there 's there 's there 's gon na be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . but . notice how i said somebody and turned my head your direction . that 's one thing you do n't get in these recordings . you do n't get the do n't get the visuals but uh , i think yes . uh , is n't that right ? i mean i think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ? if the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still would n't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the htk trainings , grad g : because , um i think that 'll be running linux , and sw - swede and fudge are already running linux so , um i could try to get um the train the neural network trainings or the htk stuff running under linux , and to start with i 'm wondering which one i should pick first . professor b : ok . well , i do n't know how we can i do n't know how to do we have htk source ? is that yeah . phd a : they have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile , in h t and you can parallelize the training . professor b : i see . phd a : i do n't what their scripts are set up to do for the aurora stuff , but </s>

phd e : channel i decided to talk about that . phd d : the plp , the plp with jrasta , the msg , and the mfcc from the baseline aurora . professor b : ok . our our uh there 's a we 're pausing for a photo grad f : musical chairs everybody ! professor b : ok . so um , you were saying about the training data yeah . phd a : do you mean if it 's trained only on on data from just that task , phd d : um yeah . so , professor b : no , no , no . different lang so um if you train on ti - digits and test on italian digits , you do poorly , let 's say . i do n't have the numbers in front of me , phd d : but yeah but i did not uh do that . professor b : so i 'm just imagining . e so , you did n't train on timit and test on on italian digits , say ? the one that it 's phd a : it 's the broad data . ok . phd d : so this is not so bad . and then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . professor b : ab - about how much ? phd d : twenty to to thirty percent further . yeah . phd a : so they were sort of building here ? phd d : and we lose professor b : yes . and it 's something like one point three of of the uh i i i 'm sorry . phd d : oh yeah , the f yeah , ok . professor b : but uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent . so i was just i just trying to understand that . phd d : what would you say ? around one point four professor b : that 's interesting . that 's interesting . do you see ? because uh , so no , that that 's important . so what what it 's saying here is just that `` yes , there is a reduction in performance , when you do n't um have the s when you do n't have um wait a minute , th th the so is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case ? how m how much bigger is it ? so it 's two times , but it includes the but it includes the broad english data . and the broad english data is what you got this one point one with . so that 's timit basically right ? so it 's band - limited timit . this is all eight kilohertz sampling . so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? um and um but , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the ti - digits . ok , now all of this is this is noisy ti - digits , i assume ? both training and test ? i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be grad f : um , but he mm - hmm . he was using uh sixty - four phonemes from sampa . phd d : so the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and { comment } that professor b : um what phd c : these numbers are uh ratio to baseline ? professor b : so , i mean wha what 's the grad f : this is error rate , i think . no . no . phd d : and it 's divided in three rows of four four rows each . so . uh yeah . it - it was part of these results . mmm . mmm . it 's uh the one hundred number . it 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline . phd a : ah ! ah , ok , ok . ok , i see . professor b : uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data phd d : yeah . at least at least for the first for the well - matched , professor b : on on um so . um , oh i well , wait a minute . you have this here , for the italian . that 's right . ok , so , so . phd d : mmm . uh . professor b : well , i mean , let 's see . is there any difference in so it 's in the uh so you 're saying that when you train on english and uh and and test on in in what ? phd e : mmm , no . phd a : so why do you get your best number in would n't you get your best number in the clean case ? ok so these are not ok , alright , i see . phd d : yeah . but it 's not a clean case . it 's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same . professor b : uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line . phd e : fifty - one ? this phd d : so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . so it adapts more quickly so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , phd d : mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . and and we 'll see . but but what i 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know , what do we do in four or five days ? uh , and so we have to be concerned with are we gon na look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . so what i what is going on right now ? what 's right you 've got nets retraining , are there is there are there any h t k trainings testings going on ? phd e : i i i 'm trying the htk with eh , plp twelve on - line delta - delta and msg filter together . professor b : the combination , i see . phd e : the combination , yeah . but i have n't result at this moment . professor b : old one . so it 's using all the nets for that phd e : i do n't know . phd d : um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . phd a : i think they have one output . professor b : oh , it 's just one net . phd d : it 's one net with um twenty - seven outputs professor b : but you think if you include that plus the other features , phd d : or uh , phd e : no transform the plp and only transform the other i 'm not sure . professor b : monday or tuesday . so phd e : yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . training , with the training test of each you understand me ? yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . professor b : it says `` baseline asp `` . um cuz there 's `` baseline aurora `` above it . phd c : well , it says baseline asp is twenty - three mill minus thirteen . professor b : yeah , it says what it is . but i do n't how that 's different from phd c : from the baseline . { comment } ok . phd d : i think i think it 's the c - zero using c - zero instead of log energy . professor b : oh . ok . yeah . so so what they 're doing here is , i if you look down at the block diagram , um , they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it 's speech or silence , and then they have a median filter of it . and so um , basically they 're trying to find stretches . the median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity . you find stretches where the combination of the frame wise vad and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . and then it 's going through and just throwing the data away . phd a : so it 's it 's i do n't understand . you mean it 's throwing out frames ? before professor b : it 's throwing out chunks of frames , yeah . there 's the the median filter is enforcing that it 's not gon na be single cases of frames , or isolated frames . so it 's throwing out frames and the thing is um , what i do n't understand is how they 're doing this with h t it stretches again . for single frames i think it would be pretty hard . phd d : yeah . yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . professor b : um . but it 's the thing is it 's that that that 's that 's i i certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice , uh uh for listening to , is that these kinds of things uh cut speech off a lot . right ? and so um it does introduce delays but they 're claiming that it 's it 's within the the boundaries of it . and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? computation ? grad f : it just died . grad g : do we do we have that big new ibm machine the , i think in th professor b : we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine . it 's got s slots for eight , uh ibm was donating five , i think we only got two so far , processors . we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processors . they ended up being five fifty . so instead of having eight processors that were eight hundred megahertz , we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz . and more are supposed to come soon and there 's only a moderate amount of dat of memory . so i do n't think anybody has been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it , but uh hopefully , they 'll get us some more parts , soon and uh , yeah , i think that 'll be once we get it populated , that 'll be a nice machine . i mean we will ultimately get eight processors in there . and uh and uh a nice amount of memory . uh so it 'll be a pr pretty fast linux machine . grad g : and if we can do things on linux , some of the machines we have going already , like swede ? professor b : uh , i think yes . uh , is n't that right ? i mean i think you 're you 're sort of held up by both , right ? if the if the neural net trainings were a hundred times faster you still would n't be anything running through these a hundred times faster because you 'd be stuck by the htk trainings , for yeah . for the aurora ? ok . well , i do n't know how we can i do n't know how to do we have htk source ? is that yeah . phd a : and it just basically keeps counts . and there 's something a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the counts together . i do n't what their scripts are set up to do for the aurora stuff , but </s>
<s> what did the team think about delays ? </s> phd e : channel i decided to talk about that . phd d : mmm . yeah . professor b : but but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another , does that is that improve things i c in comparison ? phd d : but yeah but i did not uh do that . professor b : so i 'm just imagining . e so , you did n't train on timit and test on on italian digits , say ? right . i just was n't saying it very well , i guess . phd d : so this is not so bad . and then when we jump to the multilingual data it 's uh it become worse and , well around uh , let 's say , twenty perc twenty percent further . professor b : ab - about how much ? phd d : so . yeah . professor b : twenty percent further ? phd d : twenty to to thirty percent further . yeah . phd a : so it 's the combination of two things there . it 's removing the task specific training and it 's adding other languages . phd d : but the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from phd a : so they were sort of building here ? phd d : and we lose we are u yeah . oh yeah , the f yeah , ok . professor b : but uh uh , because that 's what you were just doing with this ten percent . so i was just i just trying to understand that . but but uh , uh the same task and so on . phd d : what would you say ? around one point four professor b : wait a minute , th th the so is is the training data for the for this one point four case does it include the training data for the one point one case ? grad f : yeah , a fraction of it . yeah , um . professor b : so it 's two times , but it includes the but it includes the broad english data . and the broad english data is what you got this one point one with . so that 's timit basically right ? so it 's band - limited timit . this is all eight kilohertz sampling . grad f : downs right . professor b : so you have band - limited timit , gave you uh almost as good as a result as using ti - digits on a ti - digits test . ok ? um and um but , when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size , it um performs worse on the ti - digits . ok , now all of this is this is noisy ti - digits , i assume ? both training and test ? phd d : so . this was for the plp , professor b : i have a suggestion , actually , even though it 'll delay us slightly , would would you mind running into the other room and making copies of this ? cuz we 're all sort of if we c if we could look at it , while we 're talking , i think it 'd be phd a : that 's where he removed english , right ? grad f : um , but he mm - hmm . professor b : but you have the same number of parameters representing it . phd a : mm - hmm . i wonder were um all three of these nets using the same output ? this multi - language uh labelling ? grad f : he was using uh sixty - four phonemes from sampa . phd a : ok , ok . professor b : well , it 's it sounds i mean , we have to be careful , cuz we have n't gotten a good result yet . um , this may have been what i was asking before , stephane , but but , um , was n't there something that you did , where you trained on one language and tested on another ? i mean no no mixture but just phd d : training on a single language , you mean , and testing on the other one ? so the only task that 's similar to this is the training on two languages , and { comment } that professor b : but we 've done a bunch of things where we just trained on one language . right ? i mean , you have n't you have n't done all your tests on multiple languages . phd d : uh . no . you mean training digits on one language and using the net to recognize on the other ? professor b : so , i mean wha what 's the this this chart this table that we 're looking at is um , show is all testing for ti - digits , or ? grad f : this is error rate , i think . phd d : so . it 's it 's the htk results , i mean . so it 's htk training testings with different kind of features and what appears in the uh left column is the networks that are used for doing this . so . uh yeah . it 's uh the one hundred number . it 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline . phd a : ah ! ah , ok , ok . professor b : uh um now , what 's the noise condition um of the training data well , i think this is what you were explaining . the noise condition is the same it 's the same uh aurora noises uh , in all these cases for the training . phd d : no these are the s s s same noises , professor b : well , i mean , let 's see . is there any difference in so it 's in the uh so you 're saying that when you train on english and uh and and test on do we have any um test sets uh in any other language that um have the same noise as in the aurora ? phd a : ok so these are not ok , alright , i see . phd d : yeah . but it 's not a clean case . it 's a noisy case but uh training and test noises are the same . professor b : uh , it 's just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line . phd e : fifty - one ? this professor b : yes . yes . phd d : so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this was not correct , but still the networks are very good . when we use the networks our number are better that uh pratibha results . yeah . there were diff there were different things and basically , the first thing is the mmm , alpha uh value . so , the recursion uh part . um , i used point five percent , which was the default value in the in the programs here . and pratibha used five percent . so it adapts more quickly professor b : right . right . phd d : and , yeah . so basically what i expect is that these numbers will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much professor b : and make some strong decisions for what we 're gon na do testing on before next week . so do you are you w did you have something going on , on the side , with uh multi - band or on on this , it 's a trade - off , ok ? but i it 's it 's a big deal to get that . i i 'm i 'm sort of and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language . so um uh , the the acoustics associated with uh a particular context , for instance you may have some kinds of contexts that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other , so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder . we already actually do n't have a huge amount of training data um phd d : mmm . mm - hmm . mmm . yeah , but i think yeah , perhaps you 're right , but you have more classes so you you have more information in your features . so , um you have more information in the uh posteriors vector um which means that but still the information is relevant professor b : well it 's it 's it 's an interesting thought . but the the real thing is if you 're interested in it you 'll probably try it and and we 'll see . but but what i 'm more concerned with now , as an operational level , is uh , you know , what do we do in four or five days ? uh , and so we have to be concerned with are we gon na look at any combinations of things , you know once the nets get retrained so you have this problem out of it . so what i what is going on right now ? what 's right you 've got nets retraining , are there is there are there any h t k trainings testings going on ? phd e : i do n't know . phd d : um , i will start work on multi - band . and we plan to work also on the idea of using both features and net outputs . grad f : twenty - seven . phd d : it - it 's the single net , phd a : i think they have one output . phd d : if we have twenty - seven classes , grad f : but including the features . professor b : but you think if you include that plus the other features , which are plp , or something . phd d : yeah , one single kl to transform everything phd e : and only transform the other i 'm not sure . professor b : so i think , you know , we need to choose the choose the experiments carefully , so we can get uh key key questions answered uh before then were there other things that you wanted to phd e : but they have a question of the result . um how are trained the the lda filter ? how obtained the lda filter ? yes , um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter . maybe i do n't know exactly how they are obtained . yeah , uh for example , lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter . phd c : from the baseline . { comment } ok . phd d : it should be that , yeah . phd a : does does anybody know how they 're using it ? professor b : yeah . so so what they 're doing here is , i and then they have a median filter of it . and so um , basically they 're trying to find stretches . the median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity . you find stretches where the combination of the frame wise vad and the the median filter say that there 's a stretch of silence . and then it 's going through and just throwing the data away . right ? i mean y you you right ? phd d : yeah . yeah , you can basically remove the the frames from the feature feature files . phd a : in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of . so that sort of sounds like they 're not doing that yet . professor b : and the lda introduces delays , and b what he 's suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it does n't introduce uh , any more delay . i it introduces two hundred milliseconds of delay but at the same time the lda down here i do n't know wh what 's the difference between tlda and slda ? but whatever they did , i mean they have to play within the rules of this specific evaluation . and it did n't so badly , right ? so they did something . computation ? grad f : it just died . grad g : and if we can do things on linux , some of the machines we have going already , like swede ? professor b : yeah , i mean you can check with uh dave johnson . i mean , it it 's i think the machine is just sitting there . and it does have two processors , you know and somebody could do you know , uh , check out uh the multi - threading libraries . and i mean i it 's possible that the i mean , i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processors even though there are n't five or eight . there 's there 's there 's gon na be debugging hassles and then we 'd be set for when we did have five or eight , to have it really be useful . but . notice how i said somebody and turned my head your direction . that 's one thing you do n't get in these recordings . you do n't get the do n't get the visuals but for yeah . for the aurora ?

<s> what was the general discussion of the meeting ? </s> professor f : yeah . great idea . i was gon na ask adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff because it occurred to me that this is late may and the darpa meeting is in mid july . uh , but i do n't remember w what we i know that we were gon na do something with the transcriber interface is one thing , but i thought there was a second thing . anybody remember ? is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front - ends and then with is is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ? phd e : that - that 's what i wanted to do anyway , phd g : so . there 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done . professor f : well , i meant the overall thing . yeah . um i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow phd d : mm - hmm . professor f : you know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . ok . uh . maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions . postdoc a : ok . so , um , we uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what i 'm calling `` set one `` , which was the s the set that i 've been , uh ok , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . right now they 're in the process of being edited . um , the , um let 's see , i hired two transcribers today . i 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will because we 've had a lot of attrition . and that will bring our total to eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past january . i mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in january and and and and um , so it makes sense . uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . we 're really lucky the two that we kept . and , um well , i do n't mean i do n't mean anything against the others . { comment } what i mean is we 've got a good cause a good core . no . we had a good core phd g : well , they wo n't hear this since they 're going . they wo n't be transcribing this meeting . postdoc a : yeah , but still . i mean , i d it 's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got , uh , professor f : no backs . postdoc a : two of the ones who who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . and so , then , in addition , um , i hired two more today and i 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week , but but the plan is just as , uh , morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , professor f : mm - hmm . postdoc a : because if the ibm thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we would n't wan na have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . so . and this way it 'll i mean , i got really a lot of response for for my notice and i think i could hire additional people if i wish to . professor f : yeah . an - and the other thing is , i mean , in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , uh , i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . phd g : it 'd be great , too , if , um , we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries or some hand to experiment with , um you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work , which i guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more . phd e : mmm , yeah . that was a thing i i planned working on , is , uh , to use the the transcriptions which are done by now , and to to use them as , uh phd g : with the tighter boundaries . yeah . phd e : yeah . and to use them for for training a or for fo whatever . yeah . to to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what i 'm just looking into . postdoc a : the the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . now there was , uh , i g guess so , a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . but it happened to be during that time i needed one , so i so i started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . and he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um um . so they really appreciate it . but i was gon na say that they do adjust it once in a while . you know , once in a while there 's something like , um , and e actually you talked to them . did n't you ? did you ? have you ? phd e : yeah . i talked to helen . postdoc a : and and and she was and so , i asked her i mean , they 're very perceptive . i really want to have this meeting of the transcribers . i have n't done it yet , but i wan na do that and she 's out of town , um , for a couple of weeks , but i wan na do that when she returns . um , cuz she was saying , you know , in a in a span of very short period we asked it seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things , and she was saying the short utterances , uh , the , um and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . so . phd g : that 's great . yeah . as long as we have a record , i guess , of the original automatic one , we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries . you know , a completely non - cheating version . also if you need someone to record this meeting , i mean , i 'm happy to for the transcribers i could do it , or chuck or adam . professor f : ok . so , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? phd d : yeah . so , um , uh , jane and adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting no . for all the meeting recorder data . we should have . um . and so we 've got a plan for what we 're gon na do there . and then , jane also s prepared a um , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which i spent the last couple of days adding to . so i went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff . and so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as html and put it on the meeting recorder web page so we can keep people updated about what 's going on . um , i 've got ta get some more information from jane cuz i have some some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in , but so far , um , as of monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . and , um uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . um , and i 'm gon na have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but i 've got a bunch of uh , that 's what i have to talk to jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth . but , um , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones . and it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at ibm or if it 's at icsi , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and and there 's a place for comments , so we can , um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . so . professor f : now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth and um , should n't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? postdoc a : um , interesting idea . in principle , i i would say yes , although i still am doing some the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version and it 's yeah , it seems like i get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes { comment } and i have to stop . cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and and doing spot - checking here and there . so , um , uh , i guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but but professor f : well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as i did with the , uh , uh the the pipeline . postdoc a : yeah . professor f : and i think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , i think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . um . postdoc a : it 'll certainly be done by then . yeah . professor f : right . so we can s we we wan na be able to say `` here is a subset that is available right now `` postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . professor f : and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . postdoc a : that 's right . yeah . that 's right . so that phd c : and they do n't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version bu yeah . but th i mean , the editing will continue . presumably if if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they wo n't change the the content of the meetings . phd d : content , really . phd g : well , i if jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . and no and they would n't have been slanderous if it had been this other word . you know ? professor f : i it you know , there there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . right ? and you do n't you there 's no way that we 're gon na go back and ask everybody `` do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? `` so so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i have n't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says `` ok , from now on you know , now that i 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . `` postdoc a : mm - hmm . professor f : and , uh but , i i think we wan na so , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which i do n't remember , um , i think i we just wan na have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gon na be in , a year from now that they 're postdoc a : because it becomes , eh , in a way a a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that . professor f : well , i forget how we end right . i forget how we ended up on this , but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything and adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . and i do n't remember who won , adam or me , but uh , the uh , that that 's why i 'm bringing this up again , because i ca n't remember how we ended up . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd g : well , i do n't know what happened to the small heads thing , but i j um , i 'm just saying that , like , you know , you can sort of say that any things that are deemed that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . uh . so , let 's see . what else we got ? uh . don did did a report about his project in class and , uh an oral and written written version . so that was stuff he was doing with you . yeah . phd g : i mean , it 's i guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount we have eight meetings there because we could n't use the non - native all non - native meetings and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them . um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with , i do n't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . but we did find that some of the features that , i gue jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . um , so these are based on forced alignment . word features like , um , word frequency and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . so , we 're starting to see , i think , some interesting patterns . professor f : so the dominant features , including everything , were those those quasi - cheating things . right ? where these are phd g : spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words , grad b : right . professor f : right . phd c : yeah . i mean that would n't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time . professor f : yeah . yeah . phd g : speaking rate . yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . phd g : but we one of the interesting things was i guess you reported on some te punctuation type finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , so where you know , if i 'm talking now and someone and and andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gon na choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . and there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing even though the word features were available . and a neat thing there too is i tried some putting the speaker so , i gave everybody a short version of their name . so the real names are in there , which we could n't use . uh , we should use i ds or something . and those do n't show up . so that means that overall , um , it was n't just modeling morgan , or it was n't just modeling a single person , professor f : mm - hmm . phd g : um , but was sort of trying to , uh , get a general idea the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , even though there are huge speaker effects . so . the but the main limitation now is i because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker . so . it 'd also be interesting to look at the edu meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r meeting recorder meeting or a robustness meeting did matter to interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the robustness meetings . grad b : mm - hmm . phd g : and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person , professor f : mm - hmm . phd g : which is not bad . it 'd probably do better than um , but it was n't generalizing . professor f : yeah . phd g : so it 's and i think don , um well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , where we can and he 'll be able to report on more things in the future . but it was great that we could at least go from the you know , jane 's transcripts and the , uh , recognizer output and get it to this point . and i think it 's something mari can probably use in her preliminary report like , `` yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . `` the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard . and i think that really is from the close - talking mikes , cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone bandwidth . professor f : mm - hmm . phd g : there are much fewer than in switchboard . so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard and , so the features were n't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . so we 're just getting better signals in in this data . which is nice . so . anyway , don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , um , andreas 's help and also some of thilo 's help on this , to to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work . phd c : um as i said before , the uh using dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . so , um , @ @ { comment } i ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , professor f : mm - hmm . phd c : so i did n't bother to retrain the models at all , and it improved by one percent , which is about what we get with uh , with , you know , just @ @ { comment } actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , the , uh uh , with the standard system . so , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and so , that might even improve it further . so , it looks like the p l - fea p features { comment } do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . phd g : wait . so you mean you improve one percent over a system that does n't have any v t l in it already ? professor f : yeah . ok . so then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with . phd c : mm - hmm . professor f : which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . phd c : mm - hmm . professor f : and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? we d were n't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . but then there was a point eight percent which was something else . and at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen { comment } and wroop ! so , um , i do n't know if dan fixed it or or , uh , what he phd c : well , he made it a parameter . professor f : i mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . so . um . now the thing is , in some databases i would n't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , phd d : through the klt . all that kinda stuff . cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features , phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : so wha w what an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . so , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . so in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . and so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . you can prove that it 's it 's a , uh if you believe in the viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh by training up on local local , uh local frames . but , um , we are n't actually doing that here , because we did we did that for a hybrid system , and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it is n't i i i it would n't quite apply here . mm - hmm . phd g : mmm , uh exactly . exactly . professor f : yeah . yeah . another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be . phd g : yeah . professor f : so that would save a lot of time . the other thing , uh , just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . um , stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . um , however , there 's times when it is not good . uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . phd c : mm - hmm . professor f : so , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , gaussian mixture system , uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features . phd d : mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . no , but we we when when we when i first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this , i think that was one of the things that we definitely went there . phd g : or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . </s>
<s> what was decided on darpa ? </s> phd g : no . that was all , um , previously here . professor f : that 's cool . i know that . but , you know , which opportunity should we phd g : i do n't know . see how long we go . professor f : is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? phd g : so you just need to copy over to this one . phd e : that - that 's what i wanted to do anyway , so we should just get together and phd g : so . there 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done . professor f : good . so , uh , why do n't we , uh , do the ibm stuff ? phd d : and that would help keep them from getting lost . and , um , so adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps so . does it sound ok ? professor f : uh , maybe we should have you record a , b , c for those or something . phd d : to to put those in there when they 're transcribing . so , um , we we 're gon na send them one more sample meeting , uh , and thilo has run his segmentation . adam 's gon na generate the chunked file . and then , um , i 'll give it to brian and they can try that out . and when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . professor f : ok . do w do what do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? well , i meant the overall thing . e e u u { comment } the reason i 'm asking is because , uh , jane and i have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . phd d : i i do n't know yet how long that 'll take . professor f : yeah . um i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow you know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates . phd d : right . right . postdoc a : ok . so , um , we uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what i 'm calling `` set one `` , which was the s the set that i 've been , uh ok , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . right now they 're in the process of being edited . um , the , um let 's see , i hired two transcribers today . i 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will because we 've had a lot of attrition . and that will bring our total to phd c : oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of postdoc a : eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past january . i mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in january and and and and um , so it makes sense . uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . we 're really lucky the two that we kept . and , um well , i do n't mean i do n't mean anything against the others . { comment } what i mean is we 've got a good cause a good core . no . we had a good core yeah , but still . i mean , i d it 's just a matter of we w we 're we 've got , uh , two of the ones who who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . and so , then , in addition , um , i hired two more today and i 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week , but but the plan is just as , uh , morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , because if the ibm thing comes through really quickly , then , um , we would n't wan na have to , uh , you know , lay people off and stuff . so . and this way it 'll i mean , i got really a lot of response for for my notice and i think i could hire additional people if i wish to . professor f : yeah . an - and the other thing is , i mean , in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , uh , i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . so i i think that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later . i mean , we also just could n't sustain that forever . but but , um for all sorts of reasons but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time , then it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way . postdoc a : the the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . now there was , uh , i g guess so , a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . but it happened to be during that time i needed one , so i so i started them on the non - pre - segmented and then switched them over to yours and , um , they , um you know , they always appreciate that when they have that available . and he 's , uh , usually , eh , uh , um um . so they really appreciate it . but i was gon na say that they do adjust it once in a while . you know , once in a while there 's something like , phd e : yeah . i talked to helen . postdoc a : you know , i mean , you 're you 're aware of this . but but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . so . phd g : is there actually a record of where they change ? i mean , you can compare , do a diff on the just so that we knew i mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating postdoc a : there is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what i do is i merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . and , um @ @ { comment } i , uh the it was n't possible for about four of the recent ones . but , it will be possible in the future because we we 're , um . phd g : yeah . as long as we have a record , i guess , of the original automatic one , we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries . also if you need someone to record this meeting , i mean , i 'm happy to for the transcribers i could do it , or chuck or adam . professor f : and i think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , i think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . um . phd c : and they do n't have to approve , you know , th an edited version , they can just give their approval to whatever version professor f : well , in principle , yes . but , i mean , i if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we phd c : bu yeah . but th i mean , the editing will continue . presumably if if s errors are found , they will be fixed , but they wo n't change the the content of the meetings . phd d : content , really . phd g : well , i if jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . professor f : i it you know , there there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . right ? and you do n't you there 's no way that we 're gon na go back and ask everybody `` do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? `` so so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i have n't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says `` ok , from now on you know , now that i 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . `` and , uh but , i i think we wan na so , assuming that it 's in that kind of wording , which i do n't remember , um , i think i we just wan na have enough confidence ourselves that it 's so close to the final form it 's gon na be in , a year from now that they 're postdoc a : because it becomes , eh , in a way a a f uh , a legal document i if they 've agreed to that . professor f : well , i forget how we end right . i forget how we ended up on this , but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything and adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . and i do n't remember who won , adam or me , but postdoc a : well , if it 's only the transcript , though i mean , th this this is my point , that that professor f : uh , the uh , that that 's why i 'm bringing this up again , because i ca n't remember how we ended up . postdoc a : well , if it 's just the audio well . professor f : that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . that 's what adam wanted . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd c : tha that 's how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? postdoc a : that would be simpler , if we could count on them listening . phd g : but no one will listen to the hours and hours of phd d : talk . phd c : no , i 'm serious . postdoc a : `` you 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . `` phd g : that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . ok . so so that in july we can tell people `` yes , we have this and you can use it `` . uh . so , let 's see . what else we got ? uh . don did did a report about his project in class and , uh an oral and written written version . phd c : w wh wh wh better in what sense ? phd g : so that 's actually good . ma - maybe . i mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think may also affect it . so we 're just getting better signals in in this data . which is nice . so . anyway , don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , um , andreas 's help and also some of thilo 's help on this , phd c : which means that , um that 's not the problem . no . and , for instance , uh , dan @ @ { comment } dan just sent me a message saying that cmu used , um , something like ten gaussians per cluster you know , each each mixture has ten gaussians professor f : yeah . we get twelve of those , phd c : so , it looks like the p l - fea p features { comment } do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . phd g : wait . so you mean you improve one percent over a system that does n't have any v t l in it already ? phd c : uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did hub - five stuff , which did n't have any of the professor f : right . but all of these effects were j like a couple percent . right ? i mean , y the phd c : well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . yeah . and now we have another percent with the v t um , actually , and it 's , um , what 's actually qu interesting is that with um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the vtl in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , uh , the n best lists , uh , and optimizing the weights , um , uh than professor f : yeah . but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in or something is it was a couple percent . right ? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . phd g : yeah . why did that cha ? professor f : and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? we d were n't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . but then there was a point eight percent which was something else . so we we had , uh ea everybody else who was doing wall street journal knew that there were big dc offsets in th in these data in those data and and and nobody happened to mention it to us , and at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen { comment } and wroop ! there 's this big dc offset . so , um , in plp phd c : well , he made it a parameter . professor f : he made it a parameter . so . yeah , i guess if he did it right , he did fix it and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate , which is great . but , um um . so that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz phd c : ok . well , but , um well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences professor f : but but , i guess my my point was that that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways . phd c : so so , the thing is is do we expect ? professor f : i mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . so . um . now the thing is , in some databases i would n't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel . um , so i think i think that 's the real power of it . i would n't expect huge in huge improvements . um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . phd d : so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . through the klt . all that kinda stuff . professor f : ok . and so so then you u do you use all fifty - six of the klt phd d : that 's what we did . professor f : so i it it may not apply . but my recollection of it was that it did n't make it better but it did n't make it worse . phd d : cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features , so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . professor f : which could be good or not . phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : there might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd c : yeah . and i 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that . phd g : eh , and also they 're not i mean , as i understand it , you you do n't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . right ? professor f : so that would save a lot of time . phd c : yeah . no , but we we when when we when i first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this , i think that was one of the things that we definitely went there . phd g : or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . professor f : and and and it helped a lot . phd g : as you should never do worse . </s>
<s> what was said on transcripts ? </s> phd e : this number four ? ok . phd d : yeah . she 'll probably come up . phd g : you like these . right ? ok , good . professor f : ok . um ok . so , what are we g else we got ? you got you just wrote a bunch of stuff . phd g : no . that was all , um , previously here . professor f : that 's cool . i know that . but , you know , which opportunity should we phd g : see how long we go . professor f : is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? phd c : yeah . actually it looks like it 's getting better . professor f : just with with age , kind of . phd c : with age . yeah . phd g : so you just need to copy over to this one . professor f : good . so , uh , why do n't we , uh , do the ibm stuff ? phd c : where 'd you get the digits from ? phd d : and so we 're i came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten . so . does it sound ok ? professor f : uh , maybe we should have you record a , b , c for those or something . phd d : so , um , we we 're gon na send them one more sample meeting , uh , and thilo has run his segmentation . adam 's gon na generate the chunked file . and then , um , i 'll give it to brian and they can try that out . and when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . professor f : ok . do w do what do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? well , i meant the overall thing . phd d : i i do n't know yet how long that 'll take . professor f : yeah . um i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we 're we 're into production mode , somehow ok . uh . maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions . postdoc a : ok . so , um , we uh , the transcribers have continued to work past what i 'm calling `` set one `` , which was the s the set that i 've been , uh ok , talking about up to this point , but , uh , they 've gotten five meetings done in that set . right now they 're in the process of being edited . um , the , um let 's see , i hired two transcribers today . i 'm thinking of hiring another one , which will because we 've had a lot of attrition . and that will bring our total to eh , one of them , um , had never planned to work past january . i mean , it 's th all these various things , cuz we , you know , we presented it as possibly a month project back in january and and and and um , so it makes sense . uh , through attrition we we 've we 're down to to two , but they 're really solid . we 're really lucky the two that we kept . and , um well , i do n't mean i do n't mean anything against the others . { comment } what i mean is we 've got a good cause a good core . no . we had a good core phd g : well , they wo n't hear this since they 're going . they wo n't be transcribing this meeting . postdoc a : two of the ones who who , um , ha had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they 're continuing to put in a a lot of hours , which is wonderful , and excellent work . and so , then , in addition , um , i hired two more today and i 'm planning to h hire a third one with this within this coming week , but but the plan is just as , uh , morgan was saying we discussed this , and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side , you know , rather than hiring , like , eight to ten right now , oh , yes . good . ok . phd g : oh . oh , the new ones postdoc a : the the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . now there was , uh , i g guess so , a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . but it happened to be during that time i needed one , um , and e actually you talked to them . did n't you ? did you ? have you ? phd e : yeah . i talked to helen . mmm . yeah . postdoc a : and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries . so . phd g : that 's great . postdoc a : and , um @ @ { comment } i , uh the it was n't possible for about four of the recent ones . but , it will be possible in the future phd g : mmm , that 's great . professor f : ok . so , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ? phd d : yeah . so , um , uh , jane and adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting professor f : did you record it ? phd d : um , i 've got ta get some more information from jane cuz i have some some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in , but so far , um , as of monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected . and , um uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six . um , and i 'm gon na have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far , but i 've got a bunch of uh , that 's what i have to talk to jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth . but , um , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones . and it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at ibm or if it 's at icsi , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding and and there 's a place for comments , so we can , um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth . so . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . professor f : and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . postdoc a : that 's right . yeah . that 's right . so that phd d : content , really . phd g : well , i if jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . professor f : i it you know , there there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . right ? and you do n't you there 's no way that we 're gon na go back and ask everybody `` do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? `` so so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i have n't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says `` ok , from now on you know , now that i 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . `` uh , the uh , that that 's why i 'm bringing this up again , because i ca n't remember how we ended up . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd c : tha that 's how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? well , that 's o k . postdoc a : `` you 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . `` phd g : that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . uh . so , let 's see . what else we got ? uh . don did did a report about his project in class and , uh an oral and written written version . phd g : i mean , it 's i guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount we have eight meetings there because we could n't use the non - native all non - native meetings and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them . um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with , i do n't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . but we did find that some of the features that , i gue jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . um , so these are based on forced alignment . word features like , um , word frequency and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . so , we 're starting to see , i think , some interesting patterns . professor f : so the dominant features , including everything , were those those quasi - cheating things . right ? where these are grad b : yeah . sometimes positions in sentences obviously , or in spurts , was helpful . i do n't know if that 's cheating , too . phd g : right . um , phd c : spurts would n't be . right ? grad b : right . would they give you the same number of words , though ? phd g : it 's either early or late . not exactly , but i professor f : on the average . phd g : and it depends on speaking rate speaking rate . yeah . but we one of the interesting things was i guess you reported on some te punctuation type and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person , phd c : w wh wh wh better in what sense ? phd g : so we 're just getting better signals in in this data . which is nice . so . anyway , don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , um , andreas 's help and also some of thilo 's help on this , phd c : yeah . the error changed by probably one percent or so . but , you know , given that that word error rate is so high , that 's not a and , for instance , uh , dan @ @ { comment } dan just sent me a message saying that cmu used , um , something like ten gaussians per cluster you know , each each mixture has ten gaussians phd d : mm - hmm . hmm . we 're using sixty - four , phd c : and and we 're using sixty - four , uh , an and poorly trained mixture weights . so so , we have the turn - around time on the training when we train only the a male system with , uh , you know , our small training set , is less than twenty - four hours , so we can run lots of uh , basically just brute force , try a whole bunch of different um , settings . and , uh , with the new machines it 'll be even better . so . um as i said before , the uh using dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . so , um , @ @ { comment } i ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , so , it looks like the p l - fea p features { comment } do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . phd g : wait . so you mean you improve one percent over a system that does n't have any v t l in it already ? professor f : yeah . ok . so then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with . right . but all of these effects were j like a couple percent . right ? i mean , y the phd c : well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . professor f : add all of them . i thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight . that 's three point three . phd c : um , actually , and it 's , um , what 's actually qu interesting is that with um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the vtl in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , uh , the n best lists , uh , and optimizing the weights , um , uh than professor f : yeah . but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in or something is it was a couple percent . right ? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . phd g : yeah . why did that cha ? professor f : so that 's why i wanted to look i still have n't looked at it yet . i i wan na look at exactly where the filters were in the two , and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? we d were n't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . but then there was a point eight percent which was something else . and at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen { comment } and wroop ! phd c : well , he made it a parameter . phd d : what what is the parameter ? phd c : it 's called , uh , h - hpf . phd d : mm - hmm . oh , ok . so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . professor f : ok . and so so then you u do you use all fifty - six of the klt there might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd g : mmm , uh exactly . exactly . professor f : yeah . another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be . so that would save a lot of time . the other thing , uh , just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . um , stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . um , however , there 's times when it is not good . uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . phd c : oh , we already talked about that . phd g : did n't you did you do that already or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . professor f : and and and it helped a lot . i i , uh , missed what you said . uh , o 's or zeroes , we wan na agree on that ? </s>
<s> what was the status of transcription ? </s> phd d : i saw her earlier . phd g : you like these . right ? ok , good . no . that was all , um , previously here . professor f : that 's cool . i know that . but , you know , which opportunity should we phd g : see how long we go . professor f : is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? y y you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front -

and the other thing is , i mean , in the unlikely event and since we 're so far from this , it 's a little hard to plan this way in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh , than the generation , um , eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , uh , i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do . postdoc a : oh , yes . good . ok . professor f : good . phd g : oh . oh , the new ones postdoc a : the the the pre -

es u of of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ? postdoc a : um , interesting idea . in principle , i i would say yes , although i still am doing some the final - pass editing , trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version and it 's yeah , it seems like i get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes { comment } and i have to stop . cleaning up the things like the , uh , uh , places where the transcriber was uncertain , and and doing spot - checking here and there . so , um , uh , i guess it would make sense to wait until th that 's done , um , but but professor f : and i think it w it 'd be given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , i think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available . um . postdoc a : mm - hmm . that 's right . professor f : and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth . postdoc a : that 's right . yeah . that 's right . so that phd d : content , really . phd g : well , i if jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ? postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . professor f : i it you know , there there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark . right ? and you do n't you there 's no way that we 're gon na go back and ask everybody `` do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? `` so so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i have n't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says `` ok , from now on you know , now that i 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . `` well , i forget how we end right . i forget how we ended up on this , but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything and adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio . and i do n't remember who won , adam or me , but uh , the uh , that that 's why i 'm bringing this up again , because i ca n't remember how we ended up . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd g : oh , my god . phd c : no , i 'm serious . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . postdoc a : yes . it 's done , ready , available . good . professor f : uh . so , let 's see . what else we got ? uh . don did did a report about his project in class and , uh an oral and written written version . so that was stuff he was doing with you . yeah . phd g : i mean , it 's i guess one thing we 're learning is that the amount we have eight meetings there because we could n't use the non - native all non - native meetings and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them . um , so we 're starting to see some patterns and we 're hoping that maybe with , i do n't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results . but we did find that some of the features that , i gue jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers , which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words . um , so these are based on forced alignment . word features like , um , word frequency and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth . so , we 're starting to see , i think , some interesting patterns . professor f : so the dominant features , including everything , were those those quasi - cheating things . right ? where these are grad b : sometimes not . yeah . sometimes positions in sentences obviously , or in spurts , was helpful . i do n't know if that 's cheating , too . phd g : right . um , phd c : spurts would n't be . right ? grad b : right . right . would they give you the same number of words , though ? professor f : right . phd g : it 's either early or late . not exactly , but i and it depends on speaking rate speaking rate . yeah . but we one of the interesting things was i guess you reported on some te punctuation type finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries , and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt , so where you know , if i 'm talking now and someone and and andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gon na choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based . and there the prosodic features actually showed up and a neat thing even though the word features were available . and a neat thing there too is i tried some putting the speaker so , i gave everybody a short version of their name . so the real names are in there , which we could n't use . uh , we should use i ds or something . and those do n't show up . so that means that overall , um , it was n't just modeling morgan , or it was n't just modeling a single person , um , but was sort of trying to , uh , get a general idea the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers , even though there are huge speaker effects . so . the but the main limitation now is i because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker . so . it 'd also be interesting to look at the edu meetings because we did include meeting type as a feature , so whether you were in a r meeting recorder meeting or a robustness meeting did matter to interrupts because there are just fewer interrupts in the robustness meetings . and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person , so it 's and i think don , um well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer , where we can and he 'll be able to report on more things in the future . but it was great that we could at least go from the you know , jane 's transcripts and the , uh , recognizer output and get it to this point . and i think it 's something mari can probably use in her preliminary report like , `` yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . `` the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard . and i think that really is from the close - talking mikes , cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone bandwidth . um . well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than than switchboard and there 's a lot less dropout , so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information , there are much fewer than in switchboard . so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard and , so the features were n't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . so we 're just getting better signals in in this data . which is nice . so . anyway , don 's been doing a great job and we hope to continue with , um , andreas 's help and also some of thilo 's help on this , phd c : and , for instance , uh , dan @ @ { comment } dan just sent me a message saying that cmu used , um , something like ten gaussians per cluster you know , each each mixture has ten gaussians um as i said before , the uh using dan 's , uh , uh , vocal tract normalization option works very well . so , um , @ @ { comment } i ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data , so i did n't bother to retrain the models at all , and it improved by one percent , which is about what we get with uh , with , you know , just @ @ { comment } actually doing both training and test normalization , um , with , um , the , uh uh , with the standard system . so , in a few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization and so , that might even improve it further . so , it looks like the p l - fea p features { comment } do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work . professor f : yeah . ok . so then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with . right . but all of these effects were j like a couple percent . phd c : well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . um , actually , and it 's , um , what 's actually qu interesting is that with um , well , you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the vtl in training , and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the , um , uh , the n best lists , uh , and optimizing the weights , um , uh than professor f : yeah . but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in or something is it was a couple percent . right ? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . so that 's why i wanted to look i still have n't looked at it yet . i i wan na look at exactly where the filters were in the two , and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? we d were n't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . but then there was a point eight percent which was something else . and at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen and then when we just put it on the screen { comment } and wroop ! like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . we had something more fancy . it was later on it did n't have that . so at that point i reali `` oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter `` just , you know just take care of the problem . so i put in a high - pass filter at , uh , i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates . and so well , so , you know , the code does n't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . phd c : well , he made it a parameter . it 's called , uh , h - hpf . ok . well , but , um well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences phd d : so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : so wha w what an and you may not be in this case , come to think of it , because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere . so , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training . so in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system . and so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant . you can prove that it 's it 's a , uh if you believe in the viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh by training up on local local , uh local frames . but , um , we are n't actually doing that here , because we did we did that for a hybrid system , and now we 're plugging it into another system and so it is n't i i i it would n't quite apply here . mm - hmm . yeah . another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be . so that would save a lot of time . the other thing , uh , just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one , uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning . um , stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great . even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones . um , however , there 's times when it is not good . uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one . phd c : oh , we already talked about that . yeah . no , but we we when when we when i first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this , i think that was one of the things that we definitely went there . phd g : or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . </s>
<s> what change has occurred to the segmenter ? </s> professor f : channel five . phd g : but if you think it 's yeah . it 's sort of a default . but i can set it higher if you like . professor f : so , the choice is , uh , which which do we want more , the the the comparison , uh , of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that ? i know that . but , you know , which opportunity should we phd c : unison . professor f : exploit ? unison . phd g : i mean , it actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings . i mean , we could use them for normalizing or something , but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison . phd e : but anyway , they wo n't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes , you know , saying o , and so , it 's not i not identical . phd g : right . right . professor f : is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? just with with age , kind of . phd c : but , uh , that 's not d directly related to me . does n't mean we ca n't talk about it . um , it seems it looks l i have n't the it 's the experiment is still not complete , but , um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , w using the warp factors that we computed for the sri system and just applying them to the icsi front - end . just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems . but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with liz and and don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations . professor f : mm - hmm . phd e : yeah . we but phd g : and even the good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , { comment } even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones , but i know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out . phd c : well professor f : mm - hmm . phd c : we should we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . phd g : mmm . yeah . professor f : good . so , uh , why do n't we , uh , do the ibm stuff ? phd d : and that would help keep them from getting lost . and , um , so adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps so . does it sound ok ? phd g : that 's a great idea . phd d : so , um yeah . we just used those . phd c : and do you splice them into the waveform ? or ? right . mm - hmm . phd d : he liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps . postdoc a : it sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . really . phd e : it will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with with your digits in ? professor f : uh , maybe we should have you record a , b , c for those or something . phd d : to to put those in there when they 're transcribing . so , um , we we 're gon na send them one more sample meeting , uh , and thilo has run his segmentation . adam 's gon na generate the chunked file . and then , um , i 'll give it to brian and they can try that out . and when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . professor f : ok . do w do what do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? e e u u { comment } the reason i 'm asking is because , uh , jane and i have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor f : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of phd e : yeah . and to use them for for training a or for fo whatever . yeah . to to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what i 'm just looking into . postdoc a : the the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . now there was , uh , i g guess so , a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . but it happened to be during that time i needed one , you know , i mean , you 're you 're aware of this . but but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver phd g : is there actually a record of where they change ? i mean , you can compare , do a diff on the just so that we knew i mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating postdoc a : there is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what i do is i merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . phd g : mm - hmm . postdoc a : and , um @ @ { comment } i , uh the it was n't possible for about four of the recent ones . but , it will be possible in the future because we we 're , um . phd g : also if you need someone to record this meeting , i mean , i 'm happy to for the transcribers i could do it , or chuck or adam . postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . professor f : that it was the transcrip he wanted to do a web interface that would make it postdoc a : well , if it 's just the audio well . professor f : that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . that 's what adam wanted . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd c : tha that 's how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? postdoc a : that would be simpler , phd c : no , i 'm serious . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . phd g : y yeah it should be . well , we do n't know and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of grad b : i do n't know if that was in the like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . phd g : but we one of the interesting things was i guess you reported on some te punctuation type there are much fewer than in switchboard . so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard and , so the features were n't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . so that 's actually good . ma - maybe . i mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think may also affect it . phd c : which means that , um and , for instance , uh , dan @ @ { comment } dan just sent me a message saying that cmu used , um , something like ten gaussians per cluster you know , each each mixture has ten gaussians right . a right . and and what that suggests also is of course that the current switchboard mlp is n't trained on very good features . uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did hub - five stuff , which did n't have any of the professor f : right . but all of these effects were j like a couple percent . right ? i mean , y the phd c : well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . professor f : yeah . but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in or something is it was a couple percent . right ? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . and it it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? phd d : the low - frequency cut - off . professor f : there 's this big dc offset . so , um , in plp phd g : there was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it ? professor f : it 's it 's , you know , no big deal . it 's you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . the thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . uh , but with p l p , we did n't actually have that . we had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , fletcher - munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of p l but it does n't actually have a zero at zero frequency , like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . we had something more fancy . it was later on it did n't have that . so at that point i reali `` oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter `` just , you know just take care of the problem . so i put in a high - pass filter at , uh , i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates . and so well , so , you know , the code does n't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . so the rasta filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is another old old bug of mine . phd c : ok . well , but , um well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences professor f : uh , unless you call well , if you call vtl the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . but that 's sort of more both , kind of . i mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . so . um . now the thing is , in some databases i would n't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel . um , so i think i think that 's the real power of it . i would n't expect huge in huge improvements . um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . phd d : so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . professor f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . let let me let me just ask you something . when you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs phd d : yeah . through the regular tandem outputs . professor f : and they 're and through the klt . ok . and so so then you u do you use all fifty - six of the klt or ? phd d : right ? so one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that phd c : mm - hmm . professor f : so i it it may not apply . but my recollection of it was that it did n't make it better but it did n't make it worse . but , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components . phd d : so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . professor f : which could be good or not . phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : there might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd c : yeah . and i 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that . professor f : what if ? phd d : yeah . there could be a bug in in the somewhere before that . phd c : there we could the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the k l t transform ? professor f : well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net . phd d : n yeah . so , i u i do oh , we actually do n't do that normalization for the plp , do we ? for the st just the straight plp features ? phd c : no . the the sri system does it . so , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , phd d : mm - hmm . phd g : eh , and also they 're not i mean , as i understand it , you you do n't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . right ? i mean , these are just discriminative , but they 're not , um , optimized for the final phd c : they 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for professor f : so that would save a lot of time . phd c : and there 's a mismatch in the phone sets . so , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what phd g : yeah . that or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . phd c : because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction . professor f : but we could we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm , you know , what uh , o 's or zeroes , we wan na agree on that ?

phd d : yeah . the chuck chunks . right . and so he talked it over with the transcriber and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one phd c : where 'd you get the digits from ?

it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? we d were n't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing . but then there was a point eight percent which was something else . like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . we had something more fancy . it was later on it did n't have that . so at that point i reali `` oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter `` just , you know just take care of the problem . so i put in a high - pass filter at , uh , i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates . and so well , so , you know , the code does n't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . and it just was n't doing it , so now it is . so , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent . it still was n't a big deal . phd c : ok . well , but , um well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences phd d : so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . professor f : let let me let me just ask you something . when you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs phd d : yeah . through the regular tandem outputs . through the klt . all that kinda stuff . professor f : ok . and so so then you u do you use all fifty - six of the klt phd d : right ? so one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that professor f : which could be good or not . phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : there might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd c : there we could the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the k l t transform ? right ? we to phd d : which is right . phd c : yeah . so , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , professor f : yeah . cuz he 's probably the one here i mean , he and dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem phd c : they 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for phd d : yeah . professor f : i 'm into big ideas these days . phd g : yeah . professor f : not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks . yeah . well , it 's it 's it 's not you know , it 's not gon na work out but we could we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm , you know , what uh , o 's or zeroes , we wan na agree on that ? postdoc a : is that correct ? yeah . professor f : ok . one and a two and three . phd g : and th </s>
<s> what change has occurred to the segmenter ? </s> professor f : channel five . phd g : but if you think it 's yeah . it 's sort of a default . but i can set it higher if you like . professor f : so , the choice is , uh , which which do we want more , the the the comparison , uh , of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that ? i know that . but , you know , which opportunity should we phd c : unison . professor f : exploit ? unison . phd g : i mean , it actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings . i mean , we could use them for normalizing or something , but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison . phd e : but anyway , they wo n't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes , you know , saying o , and so , it 's not i not identical . phd g : right . right . professor f : is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the sri recognizer et cetera , tho those things that were happening before with ? just with with age , kind of . phd c : but , uh , that 's not d directly related to me . does n't mean we ca n't talk about it . um , it seems it looks l i have n't the it 's the experiment is still not complete , but , um , it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully , actually , w using the warp factors that we computed for the sri system and just applying them to the icsi front - end . just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems . but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with liz and and don was , um , as far as meeting recognition is concerned , um , we would really like to , uh , move , uh , to , uh , doing the recognition on automatic segmentations . professor f : mm - hmm . phd e : yeah . we but phd g : and even the good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , { comment } even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones , but i know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out . phd c : well professor f : mm - hmm . phd c : we should we should consider doing some extra things , like , um , you know , retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment , for instance . phd g : mmm . yeah . professor f : good . so , uh , why do n't we , uh , do the ibm stuff ? phd d : and that would help keep them from getting lost . and , um , so adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps so . does it sound ok ? phd g : that 's a great idea . phd d : so , um yeah . we just used those . phd c : and do you splice them into the waveform ? or ? right . mm - hmm . phd d : he liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps . postdoc a : it sounds like a radio announcer 's voice . really . phd e : it will be funny when you 're really reading digits , and then there are the chunks with with your digits in ? professor f : uh , maybe we should have you record a , b , c for those or something . phd d : to to put those in there when they 're transcribing . so , um , we we 're gon na send them one more sample meeting , uh , and thilo has run his segmentation . adam 's gon na generate the chunked file . and then , um , i 'll give it to brian and they can try that out . and when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription . professor f : ok . do w do what do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ? e e u u { comment } the reason i 'm asking is because , uh , jane and i have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor f : mm - hmm . phd c : oh , that was an unfor unforeseen side effect of phd e : yeah . and to use them for for training a or for fo whatever . yeah . to to create some speech - nonspeech labels out of them , and yeah , but that that 's a thing w was w what i 'm just looking into . postdoc a : the the the pre - segmentations are so much are s so extremely helpful . now there was , uh , i g guess so , a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation f for just very few days you were away . but it happened to be during that time i needed one , you know , i mean , you 're you 're aware of this . but but actually i it 's so correct for so much of the time , that it 's an enormous time saver phd g : is there actually a record of where they change ? i mean , you can compare , do a diff on the just so that we knew i mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating postdoc a : there is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what i do is i merge what they 've done with the pre - segmented version . phd g : mm - hmm . postdoc a : and , um @ @ { comment } i , uh the it was n't possible for about four of the recent ones . but , it will be possible in the future because we we 're , um . phd g : also if you need someone to record this meeting , i mean , i 'm happy to for the transcribers i could do it , or chuck or adam . postdoc a : the other thing , too , is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word , which @ @ { comment } could 've been transcribed in the other way . professor f : that it was the transcrip he wanted to do a web interface that would make it postdoc a : well , if it 's just the audio well . professor f : that would give you access to the transcript and the audio . that 's what adam wanted . phd g : i mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes , or something like that . and , i mean , i would say `` no `` . like , i do n't wan na know , but some people might be really interested and then y in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that . professor f : you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were phd c : tha that 's how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ? postdoc a : that would be simpler , phd c : no , i 'm serious . professor f : w anyway , have n't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere , so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july . phd g : y yeah it should be . well , we do n't know and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is a sort of grad b : i do n't know if that was in the like , there 's a lot of different features you could just pull out . phd g : but we one of the interesting things was i guess you reported on some te punctuation type there are much fewer than in switchboard . so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard and , so the features were n't as reliable cuz they were often just not available . so that 's actually good . ma - maybe . i mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think may also affect it . phd c : which means that , um and , for instance , uh , dan @ @ { comment } dan just sent me a message saying that cmu used , um , something like ten gaussians per cluster you know , each each mixture has ten gaussians right . a right . and and what that suggests also is of course that the current switchboard mlp is n't trained on very good features . uh , because it was trained on whatever , you know , was used , uh , last time you did hub - five stuff , which did n't have any of the professor f : right . but all of these effects were j like a couple percent . right ? i mean , y the phd c : well , but if you add them all up you have , uh , almost five percent difference now . professor f : yeah . but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in or something is it was a couple percent . right ? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight . so and and let me see if i remember what they were . one of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , { comment } to uh , from bark scale to mel scale , which i really feel like saying in quotes , because @ @ { comment } they 're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place . and it it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other . um , it could be there 's something more fundamental but it you know , i i do n't know it yet . and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something , and then there was point eight percent , which was what was the other thing ? phd d : the low - frequency cut - off . professor f : there 's this big dc offset . so , um , in plp phd g : there was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it ? professor f : it 's it 's , you know , no big deal . it 's you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever , and it 's consistently in there . the thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency , so that it 's irrelevant . uh , but with p l p , we did n't actually have that . we had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , fletcher - munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of p l but it does n't actually have a zero at zero frequency , like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does . we had something more fancy . it was later on it did n't have that . so at that point i reali `` oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter `` just , you know just take care of the problem . so i put in a high - pass filter at , uh , i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate . and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates . and so well , so , you know , the code does n't know anything about that and so this is all at eight kilohertz and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety . so the rasta filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing , which is another old old bug of mine . phd c : ok . well , but , um well , uh , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the uh differences professor f : uh , unless you call well , if you call vtl the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more . but that 's sort of more both , kind of . i mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative . so . um . now the thing is , in some databases i would n't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do , not just th the standard front - end , but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth , and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel . um , so i think i think that 's the real power of it . i would n't expect huge in huge improvements . um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better . phd d : so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and i were talking about was , so @ @ { comment } in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp . professor f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . let let me let me just ask you something . when you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs phd d : yeah . through the regular tandem outputs . professor f : and they 're and through the klt . ok . and so so then you u do you use all fifty - six of the klt or ? phd d : right ? so one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that phd c : mm - hmm . professor f : so i it it may not apply . but my recollection of it was that it did n't make it better but it did n't make it worse . but , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components . phd d : so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more . professor f : which could be good or not . phd c : but there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now and i mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features uh , either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system , professor f : there might be , cuz that 's a pretty big difference . phd c : yeah . and i 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that . professor f : what if ? phd d : yeah . there could be a bug in in the somewhere before that . phd c : there we could the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the k l t transform ? professor f : well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net . phd d : n yeah . so , i u i do oh , we actually do n't do that normalization for the plp , do we ? for the st just the straight plp features ? phd c : no . the the sri system does it . so , there 's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered , phd d : mm - hmm . phd g : eh , and also they 're not i mean , as i understand it , you you do n't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error . right ? i mean , these are just discriminative , but they 're not , um , optimized for the final phd c : they 're optimized for phone discrimination , not for professor f : so that would save a lot of time . phd c : and there 's a mismatch in the phone sets . so , you 're using a l a long a larger phone set than what phd g : yeah . that or ? oh . that makes a lot of sense . huh . phd c : because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be a problem , a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction . professor f : but we could we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm , you know , what uh , o 's or zeroes , we wan na agree on that ?

project manager : yeah , great . it 's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . okay . okay . um we 're here to develop uh a new product . um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . um you are here in a specific role . uh ruud is here as the marketing expert , roo is here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here uh in the role of industrial designer . is that correct ? industrial designer : okay . um is there any room for a little presentation ? uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? project manager : the market , we should have a look at the market . um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes . user interface : so we can work together on it while we 're project manager : yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . industrial designer : well , i guess you uh get the idea . project manager : we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . um then the discussion , maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation . industrial designer : yes , um i have some technical uh issues which i would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh okay ? okay . um first about my role , role of the industrial designer . i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh i 'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . so that 's one . uh i also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . sorry about that . um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . maybe , but that 's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . so that 's just my role , i 'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and i think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . project manager : okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , industrial designer : so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , project manager : um okay . great . um i 'll go back to my own presentation . um mm . okay . um i i do think it 's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . um sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is i think uh um most uh ru uh ruud 's uh role . um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh roo uh r uh during this part . um so let 's start with you . user interface : it 's not for uh for uh for uh philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , project manager : okay , so we 're we 're going business to consumer , user interface : yeah , i do i do n't know that . it 's no i have uh do n't have the information for it . industrial designer : we 're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device . project manager : uh ruud , y do you agree ? industrial designer : yeah . user interface : well , that 's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . for tv , you 're always in in the neighbourhood of a tv , so i do n't think think the range should be a problem to that , industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . project manager : okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um user interface : um you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . project manager : uh i 'll write down glow in the dark . is tha okay , um uh i just want to hear uh ruud 's um input for this meeting . um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> project manager : the waiting is for sebastian . industrial designer : well , during my work i have no time either . project manager : um for now on the schedule are a few points . uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . um second , i received um some new project requirements . i 'm not sure if you received them as well , um but i will tell you about it . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : then we 'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . um the top goal of this m yeah , w we will see . industrial designer : it is . user interface : or it is . yeah ? industrial designer : it is . user interface : yeah , what what does the market want ? i i do n't know . industrial designer : um okay , it 's still the right thing . okay . um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . project manager : so it 's fairly easy . industrial designer : and i think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . personally i think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device can not uh communicate with uh almost every tv set . so i think that uh should be clear . and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking leds and all that kind of fancy stuff . i think our uh users will really uh will really like that . so we can use them . so that 's no problem . we can we can make its i think . so well , this uh should be it . project manager : we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . marketing : but um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , i uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . but uh since uh the requirements changed , that 's uh not a good idea . project manager : okay . so that 's what the market tells us . industrial designer : yes . yes , we should focus on that , i guess . user interface : it should be uh uh project manager : reports rep respend response to it . user interface : the industrial designer : we do not control the tv set so well . yes , m yes . s and we b we want to make so it 's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about user interface : i 'm convinced uh sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . project manager : yeah , a peak . yeah . industrial designer : so we do n't want that . no , and y the the most important thing for people is that there 's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . and then uh the remote control uh reports itself , project manager : yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . um maybe sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , industrial designer : mm-hmm . i will . yes . yes . but um before i do that i w i want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . and there are some implepe imp user interface : what should we choose in in design ? marketing : well , t uh we wo n't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager : well , we we do have a wise board , so i 'm not questioning that . well , we skip that . user interface : well , so it just th the basic functions . and we do n't have to use it for d_v_d_ players uh and all kind of stuff . project manager : uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one . industrial designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface project manager : ruud , how do you feel about that ? uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple marketing : uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . project manager : but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? user interface : yeah , i do n't know yet . project manager : because we do not implement uh a user history . i know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um industrial designer : i think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , i think . but you 're the marketing man . project manager : okay , but w we still we 're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . um ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . we need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . user interface : but i think our our next step to look at is just that . so i do n't think it 's um we have something to do . uh we ca n't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , i think . project manager : um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . yeah . um well , i do not want a full uh it 's not necessary to to have a full list , but i want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . industrial designer : change . well user interface : our b_s_c_ uh w_ uh industrial designer : sure . . project manager : okay , um okay , so so um uh i agree actually . marketing : well project manager : well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer : the design . user interface : on the design . industrial designer : okay . well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it . project manager : exactly , exactly . okay , speech . but keep the programme and the volume , yeah . but we do focus on younger people . we d it it 's a board uh decision . industrial designer : well . i i think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . project manager : okay . we we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . um i would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . uh ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . uh are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing : um i think we dealt with the most important information . just that the younger part of uh the market is n't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . so we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . project manager : although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh profitable . we we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . industrial designer : um i just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . um so uh basically we 've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . so on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . so that 's one the those are the choices we have to make . but i think there 's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . project manager : yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? the the board industrial designer : well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface : but the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : the board . it 's the other way around , yeah . user interface : well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . industrial designer : yes , i al i i hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it . project manager : um for now we will have the lunch break . um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and i 'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents folder . if you want to look at it um well , just do . um the interface designer , um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components concept . industrial designer : well , we understand . user interface : uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes . about the voice recognition . well project manager : i think that 's what we decided . industrial designer : so we drop the voice recognition ? project manager : no no no , we did n't industrial designer : okay . well um do we really have to decide now project manager : we can decide the next meeting . yep . yeah . i guess all of you have i updated info . i 'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . and i 'm sure the market will um uh uh will change , adapt user interface : adapt . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about user interface design of remote control . </s> user interface : then i found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling i already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . and the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . so maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . but it should b i think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . so it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . industrial designer : yes . in the and it 's a little more a little bit more fancy also . so maybe we should consider that . project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : personally i think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device can not uh communicate with uh almost every tv set . so i think that uh should be clear . marketing : well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . so , the channel switching . user interface : but i think yeah , i think it 's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , yeah , but not for each button one led , i think . industrial designer : so well , this uh should be it . marketing : well , it 's this till true , of course . that they only use ten percent the buttons . the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . and the volume button 's only four times . so they 're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control . so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . some uh audio signal . like uh home phones . project manager : go on . user interface : the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . marketing : uh mo uh zap buttons most . volume , they are uh use a lot . but more than all the other buttons . so user interface : yeah , well it should just have a design the perfect design for those only those buttons . and first um yeah , the sound signal . just one thing i 'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? it should be uh uh project manager : like um turning on and off the the the lights . user interface : but but tvs do n't have all uh uh buttons . uh marketing : and even if the tv set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your tv , and it 's industrial designer : but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . user interface : i do n't think people would bother walking to the tv and press that button because they lost the their remote . industrial designer : no , and y the the most important thing for people is that there 's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . and then uh the remote control uh reports itself , user interface : just a base station next to the tv is the best possibility . project manager : yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . industrial designer : mm-hmm . i will . because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . and there are some implepe imp user interface : and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds , the lightning uh function ? project manager : yeah , it 's a distinction in the market . user interface : it will be an a unique feature of our remote control . project manager : yeah . well , um according to ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . marketing : well , t uh we wo n't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . user interface : used option . marketing : uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . project manager : yeah . okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . user interface : well , so it just th the basic functions . and we do n't have to use it for d_v_d_ players uh and all kind of stuff . project manager : uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one . industrial designer : i think also . yes . well , project manager : yeah . okay , marketing : uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . industrial designer : yeah , that 's right . user interface : uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . industrial designer : okay . well , is it maybe there 's another possibility . you can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it 's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . maybe it 's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless project manager : but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons , no display , um i mean uh i guess it 's l it 's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . ok like that . well , i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . i do n't know if if it 's user-friendly . that 's your field of expertise . project manager : but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . there 's no , but there 's no way to do that , because we can not implement that kind of the system . project manager : i know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um industrial designer : w mm-hmm . well , maybe we can use a light for that . when you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . so you know i 've just uh pushed the button , or i changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . something like that . marketing : and if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . project manager : yeah . uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . yeah , draw draw it on the board . user interface : it 's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . instead of a stick . a stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it 's falling down just a round uh button should be the trick , i think . marketing : and it 's also quite easy to use , so it 'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it 's easy to use . project manager : okay , yeah . user interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'kay , industrial designer : okay . do do you want a list of functions ? do you want an explicit list ? uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? project manager : um well , i do not want a full uh it 's not necessary to to have a full list , but i want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . industrial designer : okay . okay . project manager : well , for example , that that 's what we should think about . l how is the remote going to look ? not not in the user interface , but user interface : oh , and just one function . the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change project manager : dual channel watch . okay , well um industrial designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it 's starting to fill up already . well , are are you sure ? marketing : well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . industrial designer : i can imagine when i can imagine when you 're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , i can imagine you want this . but if you 're uh a regular tv user , and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . that 's enough . but how how often do you watch all these channels ? marketing : and if if we and if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . project manager : often . industrial designer : okay . but i think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . do n't you think ? project manager : well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the industrial designer : okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . project manager : okay , speech . industrial designer : well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . so um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it 's very easy to change uh the channel . that 's one thing . and it 's very easy uh to find your remote control . project manager : uh if if we would um drop the ten digits industrial designer : but maybe when we uh project manager : but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer : okay . okay , okay . marketing : especially elder people uh do n't like voice recognition . so then we should implement such a but industrial designer : yes . well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . it 's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function . marketing : but with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . so i do n't think that 's a big problem project manager : okay . okay , so user interface : the fewer buttons you can use on it . yeah , okay . uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes . about the voice recognition . industrial designer : so we drop the voice recognition ? </s>
<s> what did industrial designer think about the ten digits when discussing interface design of remote control ? </s> user interface : but it 's alright . industrial designer : i think so too . marketing : uh if it if it if it 's wireless i could just uh put it in the . user interface : time , yeah . um oh , how can i uh geez , and sli and show . um just uh press it . so maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . but it should b i think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . so it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . project manager : okay . uh ruud , did you get that ? the important thing here is industrial designer : um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a tv set . and the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a tv set . well , i th i tried to uh implement a picture here , user interface : energies and uh industrial designer : but it 's hardly readable . can you see it ? there are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . and uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . and i think that 's what we w yes . in the and it 's a little more a little bit more fancy also . so maybe we should consider that . project manager : so it 's fairly easy . industrial designer : so okay , so uh personally i think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device can not uh communicate with uh almost every tv set . so i think that uh should be clear . user interface : and what 's the um industrial designer : so well , this uh should be it . marketing : well , it 's this till true , of course . that they only use ten percent the buttons . the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . and the volume button 's only four times . so they 're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control . so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . some uh audio signal . like uh home phones . user interface : the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . yeah , well it should just have a design the perfect design for those only those buttons . and first um industrial designer : yes . yes , we should focus on that , i guess . marketing : yeah , that 's uh a problem . yeah . user interface : it should be uh uh project manager : like um turning on and off the the the lights . user interface : just like uh the phones yeah , the marketing : and you and even if the tv set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your tv , and it 's project manager : yeah , a peak . yeah . industrial designer : but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . user interface : i do n't think people would bother walking to the tv and press that button because they lost the their remote . industrial designer : no , and y the the most important thing for people is that there 's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . and then uh the remote control uh reports itself , user interface : just a base station next to the tv is the best possibility . and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds , the lightning uh function ? it 's a unique item uh it will be an a unique feature of our remote control . marketing : well , t uh we wo n't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function . project manager : uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one . industrial designer : and marketing : 'cause young people uh like new features . industrial designer : yeah , that 's right . maybe it 's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless project manager : but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons , no display , um i mean uh i guess it 's l it 's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . ok like that . well , i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . i do n't know if if it 's user-friendly . that 's your field of expertise . project manager : but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ?

<s> what did the group discuss about technical issues of the project ? </s> user interface : yeah , i opened the c_d_ rom box . accidentally . okay , great . marketing : uh okay . project manager : um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . um we have forty minutes . so it 's now yep . okay . um the new project requirements , first of all , um we did n't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . it 's a board decision . um the remote control should only be used for television , because it 's not uh f uh feasible , it 's not uh w user interface : yeah . project manager : uh uh we we can not make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . user interface : time , yeah . project manager : uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh ruud , and as well for uh roo . because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . um then for roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . so the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . uh uh yeah . okay , great . user interface : um oh , how can i uh geez , and sli and show . um just uh press it . uh yes . alright . um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . so that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . then i found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling i already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . and the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . um but um yeah . my personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . but um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . so maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . but it should b i think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . so it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . project manager : okay . uh ruud , did you get that ?

well um , there 's a energy source here . and um basically there it 's connected to three things . the user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . that 's basically the idea . and there 's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . okay . um what have i found . usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . that 's all . it 's cased together , nothing more than that . it 's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every tv set is controlled infrared . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : there are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . and uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . and i think that 's what we w user interface : the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . industrial designer : yes . in the and it 's a little more a little bit more fancy also . so maybe we should consider that . project manager : yeah . okay . industrial designer : okay . i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . um basically this is all there is . there 's just one chip . there are a few buttons connected . uh the buttons are lit . and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . so that 's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . project manager : so it 's fairly easy . industrial designer : and i think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . personally i think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device can not uh communicate with uh almost every tv set . so i think that uh should be clear . uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . and um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking leds and all that kind of fancy stuff . project manager : we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . so any income is welcome . input . marketing : but um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , i uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . but uh since uh the requirements changed , that 's uh not a good idea . well , it 's this till true , of course . that they only use ten percent the buttons . the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . and the volume button 's only four times . so they 're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . and uh lots of people complained they kin ca n't find their remote control . well , i just said that . and uh well , this obvious , and he also said it . project manager : okay . so that 's what the market tells us . yep . okay . user interface : the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . industrial designer : yes . yes , we should focus on that , i guess . well , the technical uh there i think there are no technical difficulties . there 's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . so um i do n't think we have any hiccups there . so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . so maybe it 's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . user interface : yeah , the sound signal . just one thing i 'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? yeah , but maybe you 'll uh get some new technologies for it . industrial designer : yes . well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . you press it and your tv set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . user interface : i do n't think people would bother walking to the tv and press that button because they lost the their remote . industrial designer : no , and y the the most important thing for people is that there 's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . and then uh the remote control uh reports itself , mm-hmm . i will . user interface : well , so it just th the basic functions . and we do n't have to use it for d_v_d_ players uh and all kind of stuff . project manager : uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one . industrial designer : we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface user interface : uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . project manager : but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons , no display , um i mean uh i guess it 's l it 's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh industrial designer : mm-hmm . mm-hmm . ok like that . well , i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . i do n't know if if it 's user-friendly . that 's your field of expertise . project manager : but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . there 's no , but there 's no way to do that , because we can not implement that kind of the system . project manager : i know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um industrial designer : w mm-hmm . well , maybe we can use a light for that . when you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . so you know i 've just uh pushed the button , or i changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . something like that . project manager : yeah . uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . user interface : a stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it 's falling down geez . well , volume and something uh like that . the programme up and down . industrial designer : okay , that 's good . project manager : okay , but w we still we 're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . um ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . we need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . user interface : but i think our our next step to look at is just that . so i do n't think it 's um we have something to do . uh we ca n't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , i think . project manager : we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience . user interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . 'kay , project manager : um well , i do not want a full uh it 's not necessary to to have a full list , but i want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . user interface : oh , and just one function . the the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change industrial designer : you 're the secretary . project manager : mielsen , because i i was writing it down in the last uh mielsen . right . um i put all the minutes i make into the shared folder . so if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . um industrial designer : but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it 's starting to fill up already . but if you 're uh a regular tv user , and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . that 's enough . project manager : but keep the programme and the volume , industrial designer : yes . well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . it 's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function . it 's oh , it 's very cheap . that 's no problem . it 's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . project manager : okay . we we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . um i would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . uh ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . uh are there other things about the market we should know ? marketing : but with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . so i do n't think that 's a big problem yes . yeah , profitable . industrial designer : um i just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . um so uh basically we 've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . so on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . so that 's one the those are the choices we have to make . but i think there 's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things . project manager : mm-hmm . yeah . industrial designer : um it makes it also more uh attractable , i think , to our uh audience . um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh i think our customers will like . the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . if we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . so that 's another project manager : yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? the the board industrial designer : well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . user interface : but the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? industrial designer : and it 's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . so that 's that 's another advantage . user interface : well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition . project manager : um i 'm do n't know how long the break will be , but we 'll find out . user interface : uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions sebastian makes . about the voice recognition . industrial designer : well </s>
<s> what did the team come up with to prevent customers from losing their remote controls in the discussion of technical issues of the project ? </s> industrial designer : so user interface : yeah . yeah . um oh , how can i uh geez , and sli and show . um just uh press it . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : so maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . but it should b i think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . so it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . but my in my opinion , the the easy to use r_c_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . yeah . yeah . industrial designer : yes . in the and it 's a little more a little bit more fancy also . so maybe we should consider that . personally i think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device can not uh communicate with uh almost every tv set . so i think that uh should be clear . marketing : well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . so , the channel switching . since uh project manager : yeah . marketing : so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . some uh audio signal . like uh home phones . user interface : the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . yeah , well it should just have a design the perfect design for those only those buttons . and first um industrial designer : yes . yes , we should focus on that , i guess . user interface : yeah . yeah , the sound signal . just one thing i 'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? marketing : yeah , that 's uh a problem . yeah . industrial designer : yes . th that 's a bit of that 's a problem . usually user interface : it should be uh uh project manager : like um turning on and off the the the lights . industrial designer : and um user interface : just like uh the phones yeah , the marketing : yeah . industrial designer : but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . user interface : well if you lost th i do n't think people would bother walking to the tv and press that button because they lost the their remote . industrial designer : no , and y the the most important thing for people is that there 's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . and then uh the remote control uh reports itself , user interface : just a base station next to the tv is the best possibility . project manager : yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it 's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . industrial designer : so that 's not a good idea . because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . and there are some implepe imp user interface : and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the leds , the lightning uh function ? it will be an a unique feature of our remote control . project manager : yeah . okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . marketing : so yeah . yeah . user interface : well , so it just th the basic functions . and we do n't have to use it for d_v_d_ players uh and all kind of stuff . industrial designer : and marketing : uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might , industrial designer : yeah , that 's right . user interface : uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : maybe it 's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless mm-hmm . mm-hmm . ok like that . well , i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . i do n't know if if it 's user-friendly . that 's your field of expertise . project manager : but but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . there 's no , but there 's no way to do that , because we can not implement that kind of the system . project manager : i know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um yeah . uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . user interface : it 's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . instead of a stick . a stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it 's falling down marketing : and it 's also quite easy to use , so it 'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it 's easy to use . user interface : the programme up and down . project manager : okay , yeah . user interface : but teletext is so uh is just scrapped .

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> user interface : me and william worked on a prototype , and i think william is going to make a p presentation on that . industrial designer : i 'll show . though do you do you wan na do you wan na sh do you wan na hold it going a bit crazy over here . this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . and we 'll first look at the exterior of what we 've uh come up with over there . um it 's gon na have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we 're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . user interface : yep . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : and uh the um the top lcd screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it 's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top project manager : or , that would be too complicated . like here . user interface : . industrial designer : and now we 've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . project manager : wrapping it all up , okay . marketing : and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . user interface : is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market marketing : the average and we 're just waiting for your rating okay . or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . um mm now we 're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that 's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . right . so i 'm just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that 's what we 're intending to do . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : no , no , 'cause th that 's that 's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it 's just sort of hard plastic . marketing : i do n't think we 've really touched on that a lot . industrial designer : it 's meant to be . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : it 's meant to . um with the size that we 've got it 's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we 're putting on it is n't that much . marketing : have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? yep . and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . project manager : a standard . it would be . marketing : you built into the feature . how do we feel about this ? we 've got our our we 've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? we happy to go ahead ? user interface : that 's all . yes . project manager : that um okay . we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . so are we still on for kinetic ? industrial designer : of c yeah . and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh user interface : an one . marketing : oh , it 's not made any difference , has it ? . project manager : we have n't been dealin we have n't been dealing with dollars though , user interface : and going to a regular bat yeah . marketing : um user interface : mm-hmm . industrial designer : but they but i mean in i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . marketing : but we 're still working to um head o we can put in our recommendations . if we if we 're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team 's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we 've we 've found and what we the consensus that we 've come to as a result of the meetings . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : but we need to work to that specification to start with . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : yeah . 'cause we 've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . user interface : yeah we are close to the budget . marketing : we are . user interface : i do n't know what it said fifty percent of the cost . so half of the price would be marketing : that 's today 's kick off meeting , . project manager : twelve point five . user interface : so we are under the budget . marketing : so we 're okay . project manager : is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? we do n't need something else to take that place ? i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : um in the sense that um did you feel like a team ? or did you feel like uh autonomy ? industrial designer : yeah , i 'd say , as a team . marketing : although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . and i 've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we 've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : yeah , i think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . it 's not like people trying to cut each other . there is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . we came to a very predic creative design , yeah . industrial designer : yeah , no , i thought it it went really well and i yeah , i i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we did n't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that 's that 's good . i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , i think maybe it would 've come out a d little different , project manager : i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it 'd be suggested that that was n't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , y it did n't matter it saying what you thought , because if it was n't something that was that relevant , then it did n't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . i like that . um um uh i 'm still not caught up . but that 's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . um no , that was quite fun . um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? any ideas ? marketing : how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? project manager : had time to kind of yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , user interface : yeah , moving around the room . but i think it 's good , project manager : yeah , i think it 's new ideas in general , marketing : it 's really borrowing from other areas , it 's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , absolutely , yeah . project manager : you go . but obviously no one 's put any great deal of thought into it . industrial designer : yeah , i do i do n't think the the companies are really concerned . they 're just like we 've got a d_v_d_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? ca n't you get the one that we used for the last one ? yeah , just jazz it up a bit . uh d they do n't really think about it , because normally , the remote control is n't the product which they 're trying to ship . they 're trying to ship the d_v_d_ player , the video player , the tv . marketing : yeah , the focus is n't on to that , yeah . project manager : i mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray but people could have anything that they wanted . user interface : surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . but nobody giving uh much idea to this . like sarah was telling , everything 's marketing : i think it 's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . there are innovations in that that people do n't really want . i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they ca n't get it anymore and it 's innovation for innovation 's sake , and i think it 's wonderful our company 's so r_ and d_ based . user interface : mm-hmm . project manager : the the people have to keep buying . marketing : mm . mm . project manager : um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but i think i do n't know , d what do you think ? do you think that 's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? and the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? industrial designer : i think that was just the the physical . project manager : so it looks well it looks like it 's gon na be fifty percent profit , you 've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . industrial designer : yeah , i think yeah i do n't from the market research . marketing : but i think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . i think we 've done what we were required to do , and i think there 'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . i do n't think that 's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . i think we 've done very well to get within budget that i think people are really gon na want . maybe it will . maybe they are gon na steal our ideas industrial designer : i it 's top secret . um it 's it is it 's a conspiracy going on here . that 's what it is . project manager : um the project has been evaluated well and truly . um and we 've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . so i 'll be delegating in my um role as project supervisor , user interface : celebration , you did n't talk about that . project manager : i think i 've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . </s>
<s> what did the group discuss about simulation market evaluation of the new remote control ? </s> project manager : if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . three , apparently . okay , you all switched on . marketing : okay . user interface : yep , me too . project manager : i presume we 're good to go . okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , i think that would be you . okay . industrial designer : um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you 've got you 've got a lot of customisation with it . um it 's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top lcd screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say , it 's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they 'd also be quite cheap . so you 'd have something like where you 'd shout out , where where is the remote and it 'll shout back , i 'm here , or something . and then yeah . it wo it wo n't shout out i 'm here or something . it 'll just shout out i 'm here , or something to similar effect . project manager : okay . user interface : 'kay . project manager : or , that would be too complicated . industrial designer : uh yeah , if it was going like i d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . um the standard , there 's be a standard transmission with the tv using using all the standard chips that we 've talked about . um it would it would have obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . and uh because , obviously , all tvs use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have n't i do n't think we actually put it on . project manager : okay . actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . industrial designer : yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . user interface : . so when it 's even if it 's open here , the signals would go . yeah . project manager : yeah , that would make sense . okay . but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product okay . industrial designer : and finally that 's how we put the fashion back into electronics , project manager : wrapping it all up , okay . marketing : certainly . user interface : so this is the one . sorry . project manager : okay . user interface : mm um i i think this is chip . project manager : it 's quite similar to what it was before , though . marketing : okay . project manager : sorry . marketing : this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . so this is the first stage of the evaluation . now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . so it 's what we 've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . the design should minimise r_s_i_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you do n't have a note of those . i 'll just show you how we 're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . we 're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . we look at each of those criteria that i 've just mentioned , i 'll call that slide back up , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the market okay . marketing : and we 'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . project manager : okay . user interface : 'kay . project manager : yeah . that works . industrial designer : yeah , okay . marketing : okay . so i 'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who 's who . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : okay . criteria a_ , the fancy look and feel . how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . one is true , seven is false . my own rating for that would be a two . one is true and seven is false . project manager : i would agree . industrial designer : yeah , i 'd uh yeah i 'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . user interface : i would say four . marketing : a four , okay . okay . two point seven five , there we go . okay , criteria b_ , criterion b_ , technologically innovative . i would give that a three . industrial designer : i 'd give it a one . project manager : a two . user interface : oh sorry , i i got it wrong . the first one rating , i 'm sorry . can you just make it two ? the first . marketing : oh , for you ? you want your rating to be a two ? is that what you 're saying ? okay . nice and simple , yeah . okay , ease of use . easy to use ? based on what you 've said there , i would say a one , true . project manager : i would say a two . i would say a two . marketing : a two , okay . it incorporates current fashion trends , now that 's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . industrial designer : one . yeah . marketing : so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that 's what we 're intending to do . okay . okay . in that case it 's got to be a one for me . industrial designer : yeah , i 'll give it a one as well . marketing : that part was nice and easy . okay . uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . industrial designer : it 's meant to be . project manager : it 's meant to . um marketing : a five , okay . four and a four okay . have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? industrial designer : yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , marketing : yep . and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . that sounds good then . i 'd go for a i ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on tv . so if sombody 's in the other room or if tvs in different rooms , or . right . okay . okay . logical . that 's a one for me . industrial designer : yeah , one . marketing : and one , good . industrial designer : i do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , marketing : so , we 've got our our we 've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . the lowest rating we 've got , which is really n it 's not terribly low , i it 's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? industrial designer : yeah . marketing : yeah . i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . user interface : chip on print . industrial designer : and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh yeah , i 'd say i 'd say it was w marketing : it 's brought it down slightly . and people are used to buying batteries , industrial designer : if if you take away the voice , i i do i do n't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you 've got it . project manager : where 's the voice recognition ? right , okay . industrial designer : but they but i mean in i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . marketing : and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gon na make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers project manager : okay , we can make the price fit , user interface : i think it is the first one . project manager : thank you . how did you find it ? industrial designer : yeah , no , i thought it it went really well and i yeah , i i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we did n't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that 's that 's good . i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we 'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , i think maybe it would 've come out a d little different , marketing : absolutely , yeah . project manager : um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one 's thought about it particularly . industrial designer : yeah , i do i do n't think the the companies are really concerned . they 're just like we 've got a d_v_d_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ?

right , okay . you could choose to have that or not . industrial designer : but they but i mean in i do n't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . yeah . marketing : and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gon na make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers project manager : okay , we can make the price fit , industrial designer : yeah . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : absolutely , yeah . project manager : um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one 's thought about it particularly . marketing : yeah . industrial designer : because normally , the remote control is n't the product which they 're trying to ship . they 're trying to ship the d_v_d_ player , the video player , the tv . marketing : yeah , the focus is n't on to that , yeah . project manager : i mean if you could have something that 's a proper funky thing , a funky item that 's individual , individual to you , industrial designer : yeah . marketing : because just going back to mobile phones , i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . we see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that 's where we 've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . there are innovations in that that people do n't really want . industrial designer : yeah . marketing : i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they ca n't get it anymore project manager : yeah . well , it 's innovation for money 's sake . the the people have to keep buying . marketing : but forcing it onto people , project manager : yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . project manager : and you ca n't get you 've got your handset that works fine , but you ca n't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , marketing : or there is n't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah . project manager : it 's madness . um marketing : i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . industrial designer : i think that was just the the physical . user interface : maybe fifty percent more . project manager : but i think but you were saying that that 's quite </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about cost calculation and budget issues . </s> project manager : i presume we 're good to go . okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it was n't uh uh gon na be a problem factor . we wanted a stand-by function . the case material is gon na be soft , rubbery , changeable . um buttons with a combination of lcd and rubber according to the design . um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . um and the rubber buttons that we 'll use will be anti-r_s_i_ . okay ? prototype presentation . industrial designer : so so it 'll fully close flat . project manager : or , that would be too complicated . industrial designer : uh yeah , if it was going like i d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . um the standard , there 's be a standard transmission with the tv using using all the standard chips that we 've talked about . um it would it would have obviously 'cause it 's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate p_c_b_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . and uh because , obviously , all tvs use this , the same infrared medium , we 'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . and the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we have n't i do n't think we actually put it on . user interface : . so when it 's even if it 's open here , the signals would go . which is project manager : but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product industrial designer : and finally that 's how we put the fashion back into electronics , marketing : is that okay ? user interface : yeah , so you can marketing : okay . so i 'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who 's who . adding those up , we 've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? uh two and three quarters , it that right . user interface : two point f project manager : it 's just two point five for that one . marketing : two point five , okay . losing one decimal place , that 's okay . two , okay . so that is eight . that brings it down to two , we 'll just put almost two , because i 'm not gon na get into silly decimal places . right . so i 'm just thinking , before i give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . okay . uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . we 've we 've discussed it , we have n't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . we 've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you 're someone who 's zapping , who 's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah , i 'd uh i 'd f i 'd go for a five , actually , marketing : twenty one is that twenty one ? so that 's four point two five . have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? yep . and are we happy with the costs on that ? that is going to be feasible , cost-wise . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , that yeah , that 's feasible . project manager : a standard . marketing : right . okay . industrial designer : so it would be s p marketing : how do we feel about this ? project manager : i do n't think so . marketing : yeah . i think for most of those ratings that it 's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and i really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . user interface : that 's all . yes . industrial designer : it was a regular chip on print user interface : chip on print . project manager : double-curved . industrial designer : oh , no , no , no , the um yeah , it 's you you 've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . in the top , it 's the number of c yeah . and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh project manager : one chip . industrial designer : yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . and they 're double curved . no . project manager : one double curve . so what 's a single curve then ?

user interface : it means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . we 're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . industrial designer : no , no , that 's it 's as an extra . marketing : right , okay . but it is gon na be part of the total cost , and there 's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? there 's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? project manager : okay , we 'll just put it in as we 'll put in as half . or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . no , we do n't step on anyone 's toes . okay , special colour , do we need that ? user interface : i think we could change the battery also . instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . uncurved , flat . marketing : oh , it 's not made any difference , has it ?

<s> what was the overall discussion of the meeting ? </s> professor b : oh , so there you go . anyway , so my idea f for today and we can uh decide that that is n't the right thing to do was to at spend at least part of the time trying to eh build the influence links , you know which sets of things are uh relevant to which decisions and actually i had uh specific s suggestion to start first with the path ones . the database ones being in some sense less interesting to us although probably have to be done and so to do that so there 's and the idea was we were gon na do two things ah . oh right , well . yeah . we were gon na do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly bhaskara and i were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do . once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . so i did n't did you get a chance to look at all yet ? great . ok so let 's start with the uh belief - nets , the general influence stuff and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy stuff . grad e : well i think one could go there 's i think we can di discuss everything . first of all this i added , i knew from sort of basically this has to be there right ? um professor b : right ? and so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do , you could have all those values for go - there or you could have go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . yeah and so forth . grad e : hmm . hmm . ok . and so i 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe so who is the user ? everything that has user comes from the user model everything that has situation comes from the situation model - a . we should be be clear . but when it comes to sort of writing down when you when you do these things is it here ? you sort of have to a write the values this can take . there we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things . does n't matter . agree there but here um i was n't sure what to write in . professor b : well yeah . so here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gon na have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? it 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gon na have to be essentially external to the belief - net . right ? and then what you 're going to need is uh for the things that it influences . well let 's first of all let 's see if it does influence anything . and if it does influence anything then you 're gon na need something that converts from the the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there . so it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just a node that is conditioned externally and might influence various things . grad e : hmm . yeah this is where um ok anyways let 's forget it . professor b : well that 's fine . well anyway , go ahead . grad d : the other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? uh well , i mean , in srini 's thing there was this thing there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh does n't happen , automatically . professor b : so it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . so my suggestion is we just pick uh grad a : no , i mean , if you go to re you know if you go to prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge and does n't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . professor b : that 's subtle , but true . anyway so let 's just leave it three with three for now we did , but the three things w that that it contributed to this in fact , the other two are n't up there . so one was the ontology and the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse . grad e : what he has mentioned before . professor b : ok , so this is w right , so what w i what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . so each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations and then what you and i have to talk about is , ok if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? but the they 're they 're undoubtedly gon na be more things to worry about . grad e : so that 's w w in our uh in in johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . professor b : yeah . but that 's - that seems to , yeah . so so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . so let 's think about this this question of how do we wan na handle so there 're two separate things . one is uh at least two . one is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that i think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . so the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter grad e : seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um professor b : i uh that 's i think that 's completely right and um i think that 's good , right ? so what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling alright . so let me suggest this . uh w could you move those up about halfway . uh the ones that you th and selling i guess . right . so here here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . so that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . does that seem right ? so we di so if well it may be more than endpoint decisions , so the idea would be that you might wan na merge those three uh uh well it it i here 's where it gets a little tricky . so for this decision it 's just uh true or false grad e : um things . so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . grad a : so we 're deriving um this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? could n't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? professor b : now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i at a mental level that 's what we we 're gon na have to sort out . so , you know what does this look like , what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions grad e : well i think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , professor b : ok . anyway so let me suggest you do something else . uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . never mind . uh anyway , this is crude . now but the now so so but then the question is uh so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse . grad e : i mean but surely the user interests professor b : somebody else has built this user model . grad d : like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ? grad e : mm - hmm . and and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? professor b : yeah . i mean , we could . well that 's what we do n't wan na do , see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that but this is a good discussion , we 're gon na have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and and his energy grad c : yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . professor b : so it yeah , there are two advantages . that 's tha there 's one technical one and the other is it it gets used grad c : s so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ? subgrouping , basically into mo so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? professor b : what 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . uh or something , i do n't know , but . grad c : i guess the the question uh is it 's hard for me to imagine how everything would n't just contribute to user state again . or user compatibility . sure , but other i thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . professor b : uh maybe not . i mean the that 's the the issue is um would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . and anyway we 're gon na have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . grad c : well , with the way we 're defining it i think yeah . professor b : right . uh so let me suggest we switch to another one , i mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this but i think it 's gon na be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land . and what they 're gon na look like . well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth . but the discourse we do n't have it represented at all yet . grad e : yeah . um this be specific for second year ? um and and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint . so this should sort of push it in one direction grad c : it does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . professor b : absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . grad a : you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the grad d : right . because that 's what we , i mean that 's why this situation comes up . it things do n't converge , yeah . grad a : um actually is this the the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of do n't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because is n't the , i mean professor b : because i want to do a little bit of organization . before we get more into details . the organization is going to be that uh the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , ok uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . i j wa i i assume everybody knows that , i just wan na you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes . and now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and stuff so it is n't by any means uh necessarily a simple thing that you want out . so uh if there is an and there is mode of transportation grad e : and it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us professor b : yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes . grad e : that 's uh two things then . but is th is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry or is it that we get for each each decision on the very bottom we sort of get the sub - e , sub - d , sub - u and maybe a sub - o `` o `` for `` ontology `` um meta node professor b : which is s if that 's true uh how do we wan na combine those ? o or when it 's true ? grad e : but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions . professor b : well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big cpt , it 's not s completely impossi i mean it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve but it 's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down . or learn . grad e : right , true . professor b : those are not necessarily binary . s so we 're we 're gon na have to use some t care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode . and in fact i think it does n't in the sense that um read it , you know actually with the underlying semantics and stuff i think it is n't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different uh ways of of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place . alright . so we we just have to figure out what the regularities are and and code them . but um what i was gon na suggest next is maybe we wan na work on this a little longer but i do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of uh well it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place what rule of combination is used there . so th yes they so these things all affect it , how do they affect it ? and belief - nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that . so is it it 's it 's clearer n clear enough what the issue is , right ? so do we wan na switch that now or we wan na do some more of this ? grad e : r basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gon na get this picture sort of uh completely messy . yeah i have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b : anyway so uh it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gon na be able to read the diagram . alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway i i let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences a , a , and b how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but um grad d : yeah . yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . professor b : right . yeah , and um i that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into , but um we have to know what we want first . ok , so why do n't you tell us a little bit about decision nodes and what what the choices might be for these ? grad d : i guess this board works fine . so um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . right ? so as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these s have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . so what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? these are all like saying ev or a , right ? so it 's not just a generalized situation like i mean basically we wan na just take a combination of we wan na view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wan na sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination . grad e : hmm . rover , the rover decision . grad d : the what decision ? grad e : rover . all of their outputs combined to make a decision . grad d : yeah . yeah . so the problem is to specify the uh so the conditional property of this given all those , right ? that 's the way belief - nets are defined , like each node given its parents , right ? so um that 's what we want , we want for example p of um let 's call this guy y and let 's call these x - one , x - two xn , right . so we want probability that y equals , you know , for example um e given that these guys are i 'll just refer to this as like x um hat or something , uh the co like all of them ? given that for example the data says you know , a , v , a , e , or something right ? so we would like to do this kind of combination . right . so , right . so basically um what we do n't wan na do is to for every single combination of e and v and a and every single letter e , s give a number because that 's obviously not desirable . what we wan na do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ? so those are the two things that we uh need . so what uh i guess , what jerry suggested earlier was basically that we , you know view these guys as voting and we just take the uh we essentially take um averages , right ? so for example here two people have voted for a , one has voted for v , and one has voted for e , so we could say that the probabilities are , you know , probability of being e is one over four , because one person voted for e out of four and similarly , probability of so this is probability of e s and then probability of a given all that is um two out of four and probability of v is one out of four . right ? so that 's step that 's the uh yeah that 's the that 's the basic uh thing . now grad e : and that one outcome , that 's it 's x x - one voted for a x - two voted for v and so forth ? that 's the outcome . grad d : yeah . yeah . so step two is um right . so we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh grad c : so i jus just to make sure i understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ? grad d : yeah . yeah . ok . so , alright . so this is uh step two . so the next possibility is that um we 've given just a single weight to each expert , right , whereas it might be the case that um in certain situations one of the experts is more uh reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable . so the way this is handled is by what 's called a mixture of experts , so what you can have is you augment these diagrams like this so you have a new thing called `` h `` , ok ? this is a hidden variable . and what this is is it gets its input from x - one , x - two , x - three , and x - four , and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation . right ? and then these guys all come here . ok . so this is sightly uh more complicated . so what 's going on is that um this h node looks at these four values of those guys and it decides in given these values which of these is n't likely to be more reliable or most reliable . so h produces some you know , it produces a number , either one , two , three , or four , in our situation , right ? now this guy he looks at the value of h say it 's two , and then he just selects the uh thing . that 's all there is to say , i guess about it . right , so you can have a mixture that right . grad a : so so the function of the thing that comes out of h is very different from the function of the other inputs . it 's driving how the other four are interpreted . ok . grad d : it could . grad c : oh it 's basically to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in or which one of the weighting systems w i was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , could n't you ? ok . grad d : yeah , well could be things like if x - two and x - three say yes then i ignore x - one also . grad c : oh the situations that h has , are they built into the net or ok , so they they could either be hand coded or learned or ok . based on training data , ok . so you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . oh yeah . grad d : yeah . um well , i mean to learn them we need data , where are we gon na get data ? well i mean we need data with people intentions , right ? mm - hmm . but what 's the data about like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ? grad a : like how thrifty the user is , or do we have access to that ? mm - hmm . oh right . oh good . ok . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok . grad d : yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? grad c : well , basically you would say , based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was , grad d : right . ok . and um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which i think is unlikely , i think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such cpu 's on your own in the java base format . yeah . yeah . yeah , i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's right . yeah . </s>
<s> discussion about future meeting </s> professor b : and then as a uh separate but related task uh particularly bhaskara and i were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to um do what we what we need to do . once so but du we should sort of have all of the uh basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it . so i did n't did you get a chance to look at all yet ?

um professor b : right , true . does have to be there . and i 'm sure we 'll find more as we go that grad e : and hmm ? so go - there in the first place or not is definitely uh one of the basic ones . we can start with that . interesting effect . um is this basically true or false or maybe we 'll get professor b : the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , so i 'll let grad e : there we wanted to keep sort of a running total of things . grad d : is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? ok , h well i mean how is it different from user finance ? grad e : and um i did n't come uh maybe a user i do n't know , i did n't want to write greediness , but professor b : yeah . so keith w what 's behind this is actually a program that will once you fill all this in actually s solve your belief - nets for you and stuff . well yeah . so here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gon na have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? it 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gon na have to be essentially external to the belief - net . right ? grad e : hmm . yeah this is where um ok anyways let 's forget it . grad d : the other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? professor b : one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . i they 're only there for the day and they do n't have a place that they 're staying . so it 's clear where w w w where we are right now . so my suggestion is we just pick uh grad a : no , i mean , if you go to re you know if you go to prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge and does n't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . professor b : and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started . ok , so this is w right , so what w i what we seem to need here , this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse . so each of those the way we had it designed , now we can change the design , but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes uh based on the th those three separate considerations so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes and then what you and i have to talk about is , ok if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ?

grad d : like they 're either true or false grad e : seems to me that we 've sort of e em embedded a lot , em embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here , for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something um professor b : i uh that 's i think that 's completely right and um i think that 's good , right ?

so we di uh from the belief - net point of view it is from another point of view of course it 's interest it 's it 's important to know what it 's selling or servicing and so forth . grad e : yeah . and then we have sort of the um professor b : let 's say i put commercial . grad e : yeah , i w i was just gon na commercial action inside where people p professor b : well could n't i do let 's do commercial uh landmark and say w w well it 's co i would s a a again for this purpose i think it 's commercial . someplace you want to go in to do some kind of business . grad e : um things . so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . grad a : so we 're deriving um this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? could n't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? i mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else professor b : yeah , the problem with it is that it sort of putting in a feature just for one decision , now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway , this i at a mental level that 's what we we 're gon na have to sort out . so , you know what does this look like , what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing , what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions and what 's the best way to organize this so that um it 's clean and and consistent and all that sort of stuff . grad e : well i think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , professor b : ok . anyway so let me suggest you do something else . uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . because what we 're gon na want is an intermediate thing which is uh the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based o on the user models , so what we we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions , so let 's make a new node oh i d eh i do n't know . actually , i guess the easiest thing would move mo move the endpoint , well , go ahead . just do whatever . grad e : so now we 're looking for user related things that um professor b : never mind . uh anyway , this is crude . now but the now so so but then the question is uh so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology , but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse . grad d : oh you mean level of interest ? professor b : yeah . i mean , we could . grad a : user schedule . `` do i have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the koelner dome { comment } or do i just have to `` `` time to take a picture of the outside ? `` grad e : schedule ? professor b : well that 's what we do n't wan na do , see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that grad c : yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . professor b : so it yeah , there are two advantages . that 's tha there 's one technical one grad c : s so we 'd basically be doing subgrouping ?

no , never mind . i mean are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like , i mean never mind , not in the current professor b : ge going through some right . uh so let me suggest we switch to another one , i mean clearly there 's more work to be done on this but i think it 's gon na be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land . and what they 're gon na look like . grad e : well let 's th this go there or not i think is a good one . professor b : well the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so that that the go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and i guess why do n't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for grad e : and so again re that 's completely correct , we have the user model , the situation model here , we do n't have the discourse model here yet . much the same way as we did n't we do n't have the ontology here . professor b : well the ontology we sort of said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and so forth . but the discourse we do n't have it represented at all yet . grad e : yeah . um this be specific for second year ? um and and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint . um well , i think um we 're looking at the the little data that we have , so people say how do i get to the castle and this usually means they wan na go there . so this should sort of push it in one direction however people also sometimes say how do i get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . oh yeah , true . so this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either yep , yay , a , or nay . yeah . ok ? professor b : and they 'll be a y uh , a user go - there and maybe that 's all , i do n't know . grad d : situation go - there , i mean , because it 's whether it 's open or not . professor b : right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it does n't matter whether it 's closed or not grad c : it does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . professor b : absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . grad d : yeah , i mean , see i 'm i 'm thinking that any node that begins with `` go - there `` is either gon na be true or false . grad a : you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the professor b : could be . yeah . n grad a : yeah , the time of day . professor b : yeah . yeah . so so now the other thing that bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that uh there sh should be a link , and this is where things are gon na get very messy from the endpoint uh decision grad d : i guess the final professor b : i mean then we 'll go we 'll go nuts but grad d : right . because that 's what we , i mean that 's why this situation comes up . professor b : well , the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the uh the discourse is is a mystery . grad a : um actually is this the the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of do n't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because is n't the , i mean professor b : i think so . s grad a : that all that that kind of decision making happens at the go - there node . professor b : uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that . grad a : you know hey there 's a strike on , uh does that affect whether or not you wan na go or something professor b : ah . good point , i do n't i do n't know how we 're going to t uh uh my current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it . you know , given that you know there 's a strike do you still wan na go ? but uh if you told him a bunch of stuff , then you would ask him do you wan na go ? because i want to do a little bit of organization . before we get more into details . the organization is going to be that uh the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that uh as we s e sort of going to this detail indeed keith is going to to worry about the various constructions that people might use and johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , ok uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . i j wa i i assume everybody knows that , i just wan na you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad e : and it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us professor b : yeah , well that , well , we 'll have to decide uh how much of th where that goes . grad e : mm - hmm professor b : i do n't know . grad e : but this eh w wou wou would be nice though that , you know , we only have at most four at the moment um arrows going f to each of the uh bottom decisions . professor b : well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big cpt , it 's not s completely impossi i mean it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve but it 's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down . or learn . grad e : right , true . professor b : yeah , i mean it 's and i do n't think it 's gon na g e i do n't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a that 's a good grad d : yeah , i mean you need actually three to the five because uh well i mean if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values professor b : each so you 're uh uh from each point of view you 're making the same decision . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so from the point of view of the ob of the entity grad e : r basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gon na get this picture sort of uh completely messy . grad c : vers cuz uh grad e : yeah i have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b : alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway i i let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences a , a , and b how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but um grad d : yeah . yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . the what decision ? grad e : that 's the outcome . grad d : yeah . yeah . so step two is um right . so we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh grad c : so i jus just to make sure i understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ? grad d : yeah . um well , i mean to learn them we need data , where are we gon na get data ? well i mean we need data with people intentions , right ? yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? </s>
<s> what was said on getting fluent english speakers ? </s> grad a : oh yeah . professor b : ah . oh right , well . yeah . we were gon na do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what right ? and so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do , you could have all those values for go - there or you could have go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . grad a : because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . professor b : right . grad e : and it 's so simple even i can use it . if that 's permissible then i 'm happy . hmm . yeah this is where um ok anyways let 's forget it . professor b : well that 's fine . well anyway , go ahead . grad d : the other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? i thought mode , yeah . professor b : well , that 's grad a : no , i mean , if you go to re you know if you go to prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge and does n't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . professor b : that 's subtle , but true . anyway so let 's just leave it three with three for now you 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason i wan na do this . grad e : w well the uh user was uh definitely more likely to enter if he 's a local professor b : right . right . grad e : what he has mentioned before . professor b : and then what you and i have to talk about is , ok if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? but the they 're they 're undoubtedly gon na be more things to worry about . grad e : so that 's w w in our uh in in johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . grad a : can i ask about `` slurred `` and `` angry `` as inputs to this ? grad d : like they 're either true or false grad c : if the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know grad a : less likely to enter . grad c : some , yeah . professor b : yeah . but that 's - that seems to , yeah . so so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . grad d : right . professor b : so let 's think about this this question of how do we wan na handle so there 're two separate things . one is uh at least two . one is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that i think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . so the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter right . right . grad e : if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark , professor b : i uh that 's i think that 's completely right and um i think that 's good , right ? so what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling no , accessibility meant grad e : given that he knows it , of course . professor b : alright . so let me suggest this . uh w could you move those up about halfway . uh the ones that you th and selling i guess . right . so here here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . so that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . does that seem right ? so we di oh , well ok first of all it 's not objects , we called them entities , right ? grad e : um things . so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . grad a : i mean it seems like that 's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and you know indoor places that do something else professor b : at a mental level that 's what we we 're gon na have to sort out . grad e : i mean but surely the user interests grad c : well is grad a : well grad e : gothic churches versus baroque townhouses versus professor b : ok . so uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . alright ? one is um you could ignore it . but the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , i 'm sorry and the user . grad e : mm - hmm . and and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? grad d : right . professor b : it does . grad d : no but , it 's more than that , like the the more sort of you break it up like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore . professor b : so it yeah , there are two advantages . that 's tha there 's one technical one and the other is it it gets used grad c : so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? grad d : right . grad e : that 's with a `` g `` ? professor b : what 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . uh or something , i do n't know , but . grad e : that do n't . professor b : that do n't grad c : sure , but other i thought though the node we 're creating right now is user compatibility to the current action , right ? seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . grad e : is that always true ? i do n't know . grad c : well , with the way we 're defining it i think yeah . grad e : and so is approaching . professor b : but the discourse we do n't have it represented at all yet . for go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . that 's what we talked about . grad e : so this should sort of push it in one direction because they wan na know where it is but in most cases they probably professor b : right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it does n't matter whether it 's closed or not grad d : the time of day , grad c : it does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . professor b : absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . grad a : you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the grad d : it things do n't converge , yeah . grad e : just sort of so we do n't forget . oops . have to get used to this . ok , whoops . grad a : um actually is this the the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of do n't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because is n't the , i mean professor b : and johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , ok uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . i j wa i i assume everybody knows that , i just wan na you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad e : that 's uh two things then . grad a : now . mm - hmm . grad e : right , true . professor b : uh but , you know it 's four to the fourth . it 's pretty big . uh . grad d : mmm yeah . professor b : yeah . right . so th yes they so these things all affect it , grad a : right . grad d : right . grad e : r basically w we just need to sort of in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gon na get this picture sort of uh completely messy . professor b : well , here he here 's one of the things that that i th you sh you no , i do n't know how easy it is to do this in the interface but you it would be great if you could actually just display at a given time uh all the things that you pick up , you click on `` endpoint `` , ok and everything else fades grad c : uh d i would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know n - many belief - nets and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one vers cuz uh grad e : it 's probably pretty easy do it to do it in html , just yeah i have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b : yeah the well the b alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway i i let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences a , a , and b how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but um grad d : yeah . yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . grad c : you can technically wear that as you 're talking . professor b : put it in your , yeah . grad d : i guess this board works fine . so um recall the basic problem which is that um you have a belief - net and you have like a lot of different nodes all contributing to one node . right ? so as we discussed specifying this kind of thing is a big pain and it 's so will take a long time to write down because for example if these s have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you know you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities which is already a lot of numbers to write down . so what um helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set , right ? these are all like saying ev or a , right ? so it 's not just a generalized situation like i mean basically we wan na just take a combination of we wan na view each of these as experts ea who are each of them is making a decision based on some factors and we wan na sort of combine their decisions and create you know , um sorta weighted combination . grad e : hmm . rover , the rover decision . grad d : right . so , right . so basically um what we do n't wan na do is to for every single combination of e and v and a and every single letter e , s give a number because that 's obviously not desirable . what we wan na do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ? grad e : um yeah . and so forth ? grad d : yeah . grad e : that 's the outcome . that 's one . grad d : right . grad a : so so the function of the thing that comes out of h is very different from the function of the other inputs . it 's driving how the other four are interpreted . ok . grad d : yeah . yeah . it could . right , so i mean the way you desc grad c : w i was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass a w a weighting s system though too , could n't you ? ok . grad d : yeah , well could be things like if x - two and x - three say yes then i ignore x - one also . grad c : based on training data , ok . so you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . oh yeah . grad d : yeah . um well , i mean to learn them we need data , where are we gon na get data ? well i mean we need data with people intentions , right ? which is slightly tricky . right . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok . grad d : yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? grad c : well , basically you would say , based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said eh whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was , grad d : mmm . mmm . right . ok . and um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which i think is unlikely , i think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such cpu 's on your own in the java base format . yeah . yeah . yeah , i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's right . yeah . </s>

<s> what did the group say on portable equipment ? </s> grad e : what ? right for each down here . and here i was really uh in some s sometimes i was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? so maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . grad d : is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? ok , h well i mean how is it different from user finance ? grad e : um the finance is sort of here thought of as as the financial policy a person carries out in his life , he is he cheap , average , or spendy ? grad a : user thrift . professor b : thrift , that 's good . grad e : there it is . grad a : ok . ok . grad e : and it 's so simple even i can use it . grad a : wow , that is simple . professor b : well yeah . so here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gon na have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? it 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gon na have to be essentially external to the belief - net . right ? oh right . yeah . s probably does . yeah someone has to track that down , but i but uh and and and i think actually uh one of the we w items for the uh user home base uh should be uh essentially non - local . i they 're only there for the day and they do n't have a place that they 're staying . no , that 's that 's a grad d : mode of transportation ?

no , never mind . i mean are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to like , i mean never mind , not in the current professor b : eh almost by definition um paying involves entering , grad e : is a very basic one . so what makes things more likely that grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so that that the go - there decision will have a node from uh discourse , and i guess why do n't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be as a placeholder for of of course . grad e : really . professor b : but if we do it 'll have the three values . for go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . that 's what we talked about . grad e : and sometimes um people say where is it because they wan na know where it is but in most cases they probably oh yeah , true . so this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it 's either yep , yay , a , or nay . yeah . ok ? professor b : and they 'll be a y uh , a user go - there and maybe that 's all , i do n't know . grad d : situation go - there , i mean , because it 's whether it 's open or not . the time of day , grad c : it does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . professor b : ah . i see that could be . grad a : also , that node , i mean the go - there s s node would just be fed by separate ones for you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the professor b : could be . yeah . n grad d : i guess the final professor b : yeah . well the go - there , actually the endpoint node could feed feed into the go - there s that 's right , right . ok , so anyway , so that 's another decision . uh what 's what 's another decision you like ? grad e : that sort of comes from keith . professor b : uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that . grad a : uh . if you needed it to do that . but uh ok i was just thinking i guess maybe i 'm conflating that user node with possible possible asking of the user professor b : right . uh i gu yes my curr you know , do n't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . right , right . yeah . right , sure , ok . professor b : so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , ok uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . i j wa i i assume everybody knows that , i just wan na you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad e : and four you we can handle . it 's too much ? professor b : well i i it see i if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be a big cpt , it 's not s completely impossi i mean it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve but it 's probably beyond what we could actually uh write down . or learn . grad e : right , true . professor b : uh but , you know it 's four to the fourth . it 's pretty big . uh . grad c : two fifty - six , professor b : yeah , i mean it 's and i do n't think it 's gon na g e i do n't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a that 's a good grad d : yeah , i mean you need actually three to the five because uh well i mean if if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values so i mean it can get big fast . grad e : um for endpoint ? no it 's it 's sh yeah , down here , but this one only has two . professor b : since ta they will still have three . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad c : vers cuz uh grad e : yeah i have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , hmm . rover , the rover decision . grad d : the what decision ? grad e : rover . all of their outputs combined to make a decision . professor b : what ? s so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption , grad e : that 's one . grad c : so i jus just to make sure i understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ? grad d : not one quarter , grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok . grad d : yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? mmm . mmm . right . ok . and um it so e either it 'll allow us to do everything which i think is unlikely , i think more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things and in that case we 'll have to um just write up little things that allow you to um create such cpu 's on your own in the java base format . yeah . yeah . yeah , i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do because yeah i was assuming that 's what we 'd always do , it 's right . yeah . </s>
<s> what were grad b ’ s updates on meeting disk storage ? </s> grad a : oh yeah . grad e : right for each down here . and here i was really uh in some s sometimes i was really sort of standing in front of a wall feeling very stupid because um this case it 's pretty simple , but as we will see the other ones um for example if it 's a running budget so what are the discrete values of a running budget ? so maybe my understanding there is too impoverished . grad d : is this like a number that represents how much money they have left to spend ? ok , h well i mean how is it different from user finance ? grad a : user thrift . professor b : thrift , that 's good . grad a : ok . ok . grad e : and it 's so simple even i can use it . if that 's permissible then i 'm happy . professor b : well yeah . so here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gon na have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? it 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gon na have to be essentially external to the belief - net . right ? grad e : hmm . yeah this is where um ok anyways let 's forget it . professor b : well that 's fine . well anyway , go ahead . well , that 's grad c : well i eh grad e : mm - hmm , mmm . yeah . professor b : right . right . so if we wanted to do that would have to put in uh three intermediate nodes grad e : uh we can load it up it you know very simple . grad d : oh yes . grad a : mm - hmm . ok . drunk . grad c : yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i uh that 's i think that 's completely right and um i think that 's good , right ? so what what that says is that we might be able to uh take and in particular so so the ones we talked about were uh exhibiting and selling alright . so let me suggest this . uh w could you move those up about halfway . uh the ones that you th and selling i guess . right . so here here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . so that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . does that seem right ? so we di yeah . eh ser s uh selling , fixing , and servicing . grad e : and where was the accessible , yeah . grad c : what would a hotel fall under ? grad e : um things . so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad e : it 's not either or mmm certainly a place can be a hotel and a famous site . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : ok . anyway so let me suggest you do something else . uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . grad e : was n't this possible ? professor b : good . right . grad e : well if he 's usi if he 's in a car right now what was that people with harry drove the car into the cafe grad c : the user thrift , the user budget . grad e : gothic churches versus baroque townhouses versus professor b : ok . so uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . alright ? one is um you could ignore it . but the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , i 'm sorry and the user . grad e : mm - hmm . uh . just as a mental note uh professor b : yeah , that 's all . yeah . i mean , we could . well , that that 's we ca n't do that , so we we 're gon na have to but this is a good discussion , we 're gon na have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state , so that 's what you 'd have to do , you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact , so it could be compatibility with his current state which would include his money and his time and and his energy grad c : yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . grad a : mm - hmm . professor b : so it yeah , there are two advantages . that 's tha there 's one technical one grad c : so basically make it more tree like going backwards ? professor b : eh almost by definition um paying involves entering , grad a : ok . right , sure . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : of of course . grad e : really . mm - hmm . professor b : but if we do it 'll have the three values . for go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . that 's what we talked about . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : could be . yeah . n could be , yeah . grad e : mm - hmm . professor b : mm - hmm . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : uh . if you needed it to do that . professor b : right . uh i gu yes my curr you know , do n't yeah yeah yeah that 's enough . grad e : mm - hmm . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . now . mm - hmm . grad e : it 's too much ? right , true . professor b : uh but , you know it 's four to the fourth . it 's pretty big . uh . grad c : two fifty - six , grad d : mmm yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . professor b : so th yes they so these things all affect it , grad e : mm - hmm . grad c : vers cuz uh grad a : darn . professor b : put it in your , yeah . grad e : hmm . rover , the rover decision . rover . all of their outputs combined to make a decision . grad a : i think so , yeah . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad d : because that 's obviously not desirable . what we wan na do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ? grad e : um yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . professor b : y right . yep . grad d : yeah . grad e : that 's one . grad c : so i jus just to make sure i understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ? grad d : not one quarter , grad e : mm - hmm . grad d : yeah . yeah . yeah , it could grad a : um does h have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the that 's determined by what the experts are saying , like the type of situ ok . hmm . ok . ok . i mean it it just seems that like without that that outside input that you 've got a situation where , you know , like if if uh x - one says no , you know , a low value coming out of x - on or i if x - one says no then ignore x - one , you know , i mean that seems like that 'd be weird , right ? oh , ok . ok . alright , right . grad c : so you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . oh yeah . grad a : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . ok . grad d : yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? mmm . mmm . </s>
<s> what were other ways to get more space ? </s> professor b : ah . oh right , well . yeah . we were gon na do two things one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we think influences what grad e : given given uh uh not transverse the castle , the decision is does the person want to go there or is it just professor b : so there is this question about the the reason it might not be true or false is that we did have this idea of when so it 's , you know uh current @ @ and so forth and so on or not at all , right ? and so that a decision would be do we want that so you could two different things you could do , you could have all those values for go - there or you could have go - there be binary and given that you 're going there when . grad a : because , you know it might be easy to figure out that this person is going to need more film eventually from their utterance but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time . professor b : right . grad e : and it 's so simple even i can use it . if that 's permissible then i 'm happy . professor b : well yeah . so here 's here 's what 's permissible is that you can arrange so that the um the value of that is gon na have to be updated and n it 's not a belief update , right ? it 's you took some actions , you spent money and stuff , so the update of that is gon na have to be essentially external to the belief - net . right ? grad e : hmm . yeah this is where um ok anyways let 's forget it . grad d : the other thing is that um every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wan na propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ? grad c : would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ? well i eh grad a : no , i mean , if you go to re you know if you go to prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge and does n't really matter which way you cross which where you end up at the end but the part the good part is walking over it , so . professor b : that 's subtle , but true . anyway so let 's just leave it three with three for now right . right . grad e : what he has mentioned before . professor b : and then what you and i have to talk about is , ok if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined ? but the they 're they 're undoubtedly gon na be more things to worry about . grad e : so that 's w w in our uh in in johno 's sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to whether a person wants to enter , view , or approach something . grad c : right . professor b : ok , why do n't we ch can we change that ? grad a : what why ? grad d : like they 're either true or false grad c : if the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or , you know professor b : yeah . but that 's - that seems to , yeah . so so my advice to do is is get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence . grad d : right . professor b : so let 's think about this this question of how do we wan na handle so there 're two separate things . one is uh at least two . one is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing bhaskara , is uh can we arrange so that i think we can so that the belief - net itself has properties and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items . so the let 's take the case of the uh this endpoint thing , the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this a tourist site , you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter grad e : if it 's exhibiting itself it is a landmark , if it 's closed one probably wo n't enter . or if it 's not accessible to a tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it , given that he knows it , of course . professor b : right . so here here 's what it looks like to me . is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of of uh selling , f fixing , or servicing . so that it uh that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important but for this kind of purpose uh one of these places is quite like the other . does that seem right ? so we di if we yes . so for this decision it 's just uh true or false and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want . grad e : yeah , i w i was just gon na commercial action inside where people p and where was the accessible , yeah . professor b : whereas this is a i would call that a service , but but i do n't know . grad e : um things . so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things . grad a : so we 're deriving um this the this feature of whether the the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what kind of activity is done there ? could n't you have it as just a primitive feature of the entity ? professor b : well you could , that 's a that 's a choice . at a mental level that 's what we we 're gon na have to sort out . grad e : well i think an entity maybe should be regard as a vector of several possible things , it can either em do s do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be a landmark at the same time as doing these things , many come to mind . things can be generally um a landmark and be accessible . ie a a castle or can be a landmark a or not accessible , some statue professor b : ok . anyway so let me suggest you do something else . uh which is to get rid get rid of that l long link between who the user and the endpoint . underscore - e for entity , and we may change all this , but . right . and grad e : i mean but surely the user interests grad c : well is professor b : ok . so uh you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that . alright ? one is um you could ignore it . but the other thing you could do is have an and this will give you the flavor of the of what you could have a node that 's that was a measure of the match between the object 's feature , you know , the match between the object the entity , i 'm sorry and the user . grad e : mm - hmm . and and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering ? professor b : yeah . i mean , we could . right . well that 's what we do n't wan na do , see that se cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and stuff like that grad d : right . professor b : well , that that 's we ca n't do that , so we we 're gon na have to grad c : yeah , just seems like it 'd push the problem back a level . grad d : right . professor b : so it yeah , there are two advantages . that 's tha there 's one technical one and the other is it it gets used grad d : right . professor b : so that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u grad d : right . professor b : what 's th what we 're talking about is compatibility . uh or something , i do n't know , but . grad e : that do n't . professor b : that do n't grad e : the user interests and the user who who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke professor b : uh maybe not . i mean the that 's the the issue is um would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of . and anyway we 're gon na have to find some way to cl uh get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible . grad c : well , with the way we 're defining it i think yeah . grad e : and so is approaching . professor b : eh almost by definition um paying involves entering , grad e : is a very basic one . so what makes things more likely that professor b : but the discourse we do n't have it represented at all yet . for go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say . that 's what we talked about . grad e : so this should sort of push it in one direction professor b : right . grad e : however people also sometimes say how do i get there in order to find out how to get there without wanting to go there . because they wan na know where it is but in most cases they probably grad d : situation go - there , i mean , because it 's whether it 's open or not . um the that interacts with the uh eva thing if they just wan na view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed whereas if they want to um professor b : right . right , so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting , so what uh bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they 're only going to view it then it does n't matter whether it 's closed or not in terms of uh uh you know , whether whether you wan na go there . grad c : it does matter though if there 's like a strike or riot or something . professor b : absolutely there are other situational things that do matter . well i i it can have di various values . yeah , but we eh you you 're right it might not be enough . grad d : yeah , i mean , see i 'm i 'm thinking that any node that begins with `` go - there `` is either gon na be true or false . grad a : right . also , that node , i mean the go - there s s node would just be fed by separate ones for you know , there 's different things , the strikes and the professor b : could be , yeah . grad d : it things do n't converge , yeah . yeah . well , but the good thing is we we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love . professor b : right . grad e : just sort of so we do n't forget . oops . have to get used to this . ok , whoops . grad a : um actually is this the the right way to have it where um go there from the user and go there from the situation just sort of do n't know about each other but they both feed the go there decision because is n't the , i mean professor b : maybe not , a right . uh y you yeah you i you if you needed to do that . grad a : uh . if you needed it to do that . professor b : and the question would n't itself be one of these conditional things and johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard , so what 's going to happen is that eventually like by the time he graduates , ok uh they 'll be some sort of system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net . i j wa i i assume everybody knows that , i just wan na you know , get closure that that 'll be the game then , grad e : and it there 's a sort of also a split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said what 's the utterance go giving us that 's uh two things then . but it might just right , true . professor b : yeah , i mean it 's and i do n't think it 's gon na g e i do n't think it 'll get worse than that by the way , so le that 's a that 's a good grad d : mmm yeah . grad c : right . professor b : right . so th yes they so these things all affect it , grad a : right . grad d : right . grad c : uh d i would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make you know n - many belief - nets and then open them every time you wanted to look at a different one vers cuz uh grad e : yeah i have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be be a page and then you click on the thing and then li consider that it 's respective , professor b : yeah the well the b alright , so e we have to figure out some eh eh uh basically display hack or something to do this because anyway i i let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration , we have two first - order considerations which is what are the uh influences a , a , and b how do they get combined mathematically , how do we display them is an issue , but um grad d : yeah . yeah , i i mean , it might soon , if this is gon na be used in a serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to uh start modifying it for our purposes . because that 's obviously not desirable . what we wan na do is find some principled way of um saying what each of these is and we want it to be a valid probability distribution , so we want it to um add up to one , right ? professor b : s so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this sort of things , which may or may not be a good assumption , grad d : yeah . yeah . so step two is um right . so we 've assumed equal weights whereas it might turn out that you know , some w be that for example , what the um the actual the uh verbal content of what the person said , like what uh what might be uh somehow more uh important than the uh grad e : that 's one . grad c : so i jus just to make sure i understand this , so in this case um we would still compute the average ? grad d : right , so i mean the way you desc grad c : so you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations . oh yeah . grad d : yeah , but that 's my question , like how do we i mean , how do we have data about something like um um endpoint sub - e , or endpoint sub uh you know s s ? mmm . mmm . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> marketing : plate ? industrial designer : i do . marketing : test . project manager : so you all read what we are going to do or not ? i just made a a simple uh presentation . so you put some things in it . so no okay have a look at that one . okay . so uh what we 're going to do first is um so you can read . you have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard marketing : so i first uh draw the water . mm-hmm . so . um project manager : just make a new blank new blank page . user interface : yeah . marketing : well paul ? user interface : yeah . like this ? project manager : yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top . user interface : um project manager : uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so . user interface : it but you actually got to write on the paper . you really got to write on that paper . project manager : it 's not that cool as i th thought it would be . i do n't know , what time did we start this meeting , i 'm not sure . okay , perfect . yeah , thank you . now we just have to save everything , so . that 's . and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , so we have to uh use a big market in europe . the production cost are about half the price of selling price , so can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , i dunno . uh so we 're gon na have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . marketing : yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . so i user interface : universal . marketing : because yeah , i think . project manager : yeah , everything industrial designer : and user interface : not just a tv . project manager : no , just everything . . so yeah , so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user user interface : well but i do n't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . maybe more trendy . where you can see uh more options . i think industrial designer : uh maybe be uh it 's it 's user interface : yeah , too fragile . industrial designer : yeah , i dunno . but i do n't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . project manager : the option , just the option , that 's cool . marketing : yeah , i do n't i do n't know i do n't know project manager : or user interface : well i think we have to look at that , marketing : you can make it very special , to create our own um looks , industrial designer : n uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . marketing : yeah yeah , what paul already said . project manager : yeah , just for the tv and just the normal function , that 's fine . user interface : that 's what i meant . okay , but yeah . project manager : just think about it . we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . there 's some more things . we have uh another thirty minutes , so then we 're going to meet again . so you know what you have to what you have to do ? marketing : um for m for me uh the marketing expert , the user requirements uh specification , do i need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the project manager : yeah , i think this if you you have to n know if it 's for s a tv , a d_v_d_ player , all that things . also from a user , but all these things together . marketing : okay . yeah , it 's also about strength and uh for everything uh . project manager : yeah , everything . user interface : yeah , i also wrote down some stuff i already wrote some down , some ideas . i will . </s>
<s> what did the group talk about the conceptual design of the remote control , including the functions and some possible advanced techniques ? </s> marketing : user interface : yes that one . project manager : ah cool . okay . so marketing : project manager : that 's my name , . uh we 're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . just have a look , are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . you know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . so um the thing we have to know is you already know what we 're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , okay . so um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that 's what we 're going to design . uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . fir the first thing is th the functional design , that 's very important . we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that 's where we 're going to look in the functional design , it 's for the f next meeting . the the second thing is the conceptual design , that 's what it that 's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . and we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . and the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that 's exa yeah , you know what it is , it 's exactly how it looks and whatever . okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . marketing : folder , project manager : folder , okay . so no okay have a look at that one . okay . so uh what we 're going to do first is um so you can read . you have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard marketing : project manager : and um and say why it 's your favourite animal . so and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . so okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . yes ? marketing : ah i can see it now . user interface : industrial designer : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : just takes so long , okay . whatever , just . you erased this one . it 's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . user interface : project manager : hmm yeah , that 's nice . industrial designer : wow . project manager : yeah , thank you . now we just have to save everything , so . marketing : industrial designer : marketing : user interface : project manager : okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five euros . okay , user interface : piece of cake . project manager : so can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , i dunno . uh so we 're gon na have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . marketing : yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? project manager : oh yeah , that 's a good question . marketing : because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . project manager : i do n't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five euros , so not sure , but just so a lot of buttons on the remote control . what what what 's a remote control , it 's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it 's not nothing very special , but um yeah , that 's right . so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user marketing : well i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we do n't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that 's no matter . um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gon na use it , so uh it 's not only for the uh technical persons . um i think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . project manager : hmm yeah . user interface : project manager : that 's right . should be a good point . user interface : yeah . marketing : no . yeah . user interface : it should n't be too big , but i do n't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : we ca n't make it smaller than the things we see now i think . project manager : just big enough for the buttons we have , that 's that 's it . user interface : yeah . or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . project manager : yeah , that 's cool . maybe for the d_v_d_ pla player or something , marketing : and we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , project manager : no . you can put games on your remote control . whatever . user interface : maybe uh use it as a separate option . sell it uh separately . project manager : the option , just the option , that 's cool . marketing : uh it has to lay good in the hand , project manager : has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control user interface : well i think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you wo n't industrial designer : n uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . user interface : well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the tv channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . so it does n't matter what place it is on the remote control i think , so you can do something unique with that . marketing : yeah yeah , what paul already said . project manager : yeah , just for the tv and just the normal function , that 's fine . marketing : mm . if you if if you make to fold open it 's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . project manager : no , that 's right . so maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control . user interface : okay , but yeah . project manager : we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . yeah , i think this if you you have to n know if it 's for s a tv , a d_v_d_ player , all that things . also from a user , but all these things together . </s>
<s> what did the project manager think of the remote control when talking about the conceptual design of the remote control ? </s> marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : i just made a a simple uh presentation . so you put some things in it . marketing : folder , project manager : folder , okay . user interface : yeah . looks very nice . project manager : i just h just takes so long , okay . whatever , just . you erased this one . it 's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . marketing : yeah yeah , but it 's an animal it 's an animal that lives in the water . project manager : okay . okay okay . okay . marketing : mm-hmm . so . um user interface : project manager : hmm yeah , that 's nice . user interface : yeah . like this ? project manager : yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top . user interface : ah okay . project manager : no , that 's okay , thank you . user interface : yeah , that 's right , project manager : yeah , i know , but i d i i thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in word , so that 's not user interface : yeah , but it 's just a picture . project manager : it 's not that cool as i th thought it would be . yeah , thank you . now we just have to save everything , so . marketing : project manager : oh marketing : project manager : okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five euros . okay , industrial designer : excuse me . user interface : piece of cake . marketing : yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? project manager : oh yeah , that 's a good question . marketing : because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . user interface : ah okay . marketing : yeah , i think . industrial designer : and uh also for the v_c_r_ and uh d_v_d_ player project manager : yeah , everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control . user interface : not just a tv . well we can try to make it special . project manager : yeah , that 's right . so do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user hmm yeah . that 's right . should be a good point . user interface : yeah . it should n't be too big , but i do n't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : yeah . or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . project manager : yeah , that 's cool . maybe for the d_v_d_ pla player or something , yeah , that 's right , yeah . the option , just the option , that 's cool . marketing : uh it has to lay good in the hand , yeah , i do n't i do n't know i do n't know user interface : well i think we have to look at that , marketing : but it 's very hard to industrial designer : n uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . yeah . project manager : yeah . user interface : so it does n't matter what place it is on the remote control i think , industrial designer : yeah . user interface : so you can do something unique with that . marketing : yeah yeah , what paul already said . project manager : yeah , just for the tv and just the normal function , that 's fine . user interface : that 's what i meant . okay , but yeah . project manager : just think about it . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . yeah . yeah , everything . user interface : yeah , i also wrote down some stuff your fault . </s>

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> industrial designer : industrial design . project manager : and after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . mm so um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . industrial designer : one one . project manager : so i 'll i let david jordan do his presentation . user interface : so my job is to uh design a google tv controller which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . so that 's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . project manager : many functions and very easy to use . user interface : but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . industrial designer : yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . yeah , yeah . for example , i dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the google system to the system , alright . marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . industrial designer : that 's your job project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or so we can move to the next slide . as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the project manager : mm-hmm . industrial designer : yeah , i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it 's better to have uh uh let 's see . yeah . you can move to the next slide , so . so the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . yeah , but some pa i always want to have you know , marketing : the wire ? yeah . true . project manager : so i will let you to do your presentation , so . you mean the loo the look , the outside ? marketing : yeah , the the look is is bad for them so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , i think . um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . and uh remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . manual . project manager : yeah , but it has to be intuitive . user interface : then it switch to another category of functions . yeah . for example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your tv and also you can control your uh recorder . industrial designer : this is a question that should be asked to the if you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . user interface : because different people have a different opinion about fancy . you know . marketing : yeah , this is something we sh but this was first step and this was the first step , yeah . specially distribution , yeah . project manager : and to discuss it with uh the other members . so , is it okay for your presentation ? nothing else to to add ? so , i had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we do n't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it 's something that 's so , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , marketing : mm-hmm project manager : which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . is it okay ? user interface : okay . but there 's balance between function and the cost . project manager : and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . user interface : mm-hm . project manager : require lot of requirements , yeah . but uh that 's your your job to find something mm matches . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , 'cause what i 'm thinking is how will you will connect the tv to internet , so . yeah , but this this mean that your tv would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . marketing : hm-mm . industrial designer : the global usage , user interface : global , project manager : so everybody is okay with the new requirements ? user interface : so i i so as as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager : yeah . it has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . just when you enter you say oh , oh , it 's real reaction . think it 's a re reaction remote control , so . industrial designer : but i dunno , but why , nobody 's a threat to me . project manager : i think it would be simpler . okay . so i will close the meeting , um just after that we 'll have lunch break . and you will have in thirty minutes individual work . uh y you you will have as the i_d_ i do n't remember what is industr industrial designer to put um pon and florent to work my subject . and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . i think the um session is closed . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about product requirements . </s> industrial designer : david jordan ? mm-hmm . user interface : mm yeah . project manager : so i 'll i let david jordan do his presentation . marketing : no , no . uh this one does n't want to be moved , i think . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : uh i i will focus on user interface design . um so move to the next slide . as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . there 's a lot of functions . over , i think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote tv control . so how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? um , let 's move to next slide . um . yeah . so i so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . a very good example is google . as we know uh google it 's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . um so move to next s slide . so my job is to uh design a google tv controller which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . so project manager : many functions and very easy to use . user interface : but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . industrial designer : that 's your job project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . user interface : powerful and easy to use . project manager : so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or project manager : marketing : industrial designer : so you know , so it 's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to project manager : so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer : i think it 's cheaper than laser , so . project manager : yeah . do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? twelve , nearly thirteen , industrial designer : so and the next slide , it is the last one it 's so it 's i think it should be wire wireless re remote con because you know , it 's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , i at my side prefer a wireless . okay , so if you have some question i did n't answer ? marketing : what 's the average price of this technology then ? user interface : so what , the wireless remote control ? there 's a wire with remote control ? project manager : i think it 's more your problem . mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . marketing : uh that 's my job . that 's the project manager : okay , i 'm sorry . industrial designer : yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it 's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer , but you know . if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . user interface : design a wireless remote control . marketing : well that 's actually one of the point , yeah ? true . which is participant four . so just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . we 've made a study , so could you go to next slide . project manager : marketing : okay . so then it 's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that 's yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it 's your job , david , maybe . then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . so this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , i guess , if people are ready to pay more . so it 's it 's interesting information , i think . and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you 've shown previously it 's not so does n't fit the user requirements sometime , because it 's too many buttons and so on . so we should change this as well . and uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they 're using the device intensively , that 's something to take into account as well . and um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . and uh this is one of the main point for me . but i 'll come back to it later . 'kay . could you go next slide ? uh , so as you said uh , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . project manager : marketing : so this is from the experiments we 've done , project manager : marketing : so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , i think . um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . and uh remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager : what is r_s_i_ ? marketing : r_s_i_ is like , when you 're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ah um okay . marketing : okay ? so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . so last slide . um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . this would definitely be a good way of selling more . okay . project manager : yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? yeah , but it has to be intuitive . industrial designer : this is a question that should be asked to the if you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . user interface : some people prefer black remote control . project manager : and we do n't really want the price to be too too high , because we wan na be able to produce it . so , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it 's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . marketing : yeah , it 's done , just yeah . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it . project manager : so , i had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we do n't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it 's something that 's it 's which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . is it okay ? user interface : okay . but there 's balance between function and the cost . project manager : so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . yeah . as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . so everybody is okay with the new requirements ? why you go it has to be fashion . marketing : and that 's it . </s>
<s> what did the user interface designer and the industrial designer recommend to do when discussing the product requirement and why ? </s> user interface : so my job is to uh design a google tv controller which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . so project manager : so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . industrial designer : to merge the two system huh . user interface : but if we have very very good user interface industrial designer : yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . industrial designer : that 's your job it you project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . user interface : yeah , that 's the point . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one i h i 'm holding in my hand and the tv . so , this one is leather bu based but i propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me i think that it is better it 's bet it 's better to control tv so you know , so it 's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to project manager : so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? industrial designer : i think it 's cheaper than laser , so . marketing : that might just so . industrial designer : you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . look . but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . well the avera the average prices i think that this technology will cost , i dunno , around eight euros , so . or at least you know , the user interface : so what , the wireless remote control ? there 's a wire with remote control ? project manager : so you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the tv wo n't be a good idea . no it wou maybe it will be cheaper i dunno , i just may maybe you making a solu yeah , user interface : wireless remote control . project manager : yeah but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer : project manager : i 'm just asking you . do you think it will be cheaper ? industrial designer : uh , i do n't think it will be too much . i think wha wha with the wire it 's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it 's more practical , so . project manager : i think it 's more your problem . mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . industrial designer : yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it 's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer , but you know . if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . project manager : so user interface : design a wireless remote control . project manager : yeah . just think of the problem . if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? i think it 's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , industrial designer : okay . project manager : marketing : yeah , the the look is is bad for them so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , i think . um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . and uh remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . this would definitely be a good way of selling more . okay . project manager : yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? yeah , but it has to be intuitive . yeah , but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . user interface : some people prefer black remote control . maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , project manager : yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , marketing : yeah , it 's done , just yeah . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it . project manager : no yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it 's better to use internet then teletext . so , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , it 's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . is it okay ? user interface : okay . but there 's balance between function and the cost . project manager : so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . i mean that 's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it 's our product . yeah . as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . industrial designer : for cheap remote control , yeah . user interface : yeah . and cheap . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , 'cause what i 'm thinking is how will you will connect the tv to internet , so . marketing : i do n't think it 's part of the remote control design anyway . industrial designer : it 's pop i do n't think it 's popular , so that 's the problem so . you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know so if people do n't have the technology . project manager : because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . it 's okay ?

<s> summarize the discussion about the internet connection . </s> project manager : so i 'll i let david jordan do his presentation . marketing : so , i dunno , it 's maybe difficult to have both , industrial designer : but but this is user interface : it take less time for user to learn how to use it . industrial designer : so you have to the sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that so . project manager : go on , go back and marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . industrial designer : that 's your job user interface : that 's my job . it 's not the easiest i 've got to . industrial designer : it you project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . marketing : so that 's the point . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or so you know , so it 's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to i think it 's cheaper than laser , so . marketing : what the cost is ? twelve , twelve a half . industrial designer : yeah , i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it 's better to have uh uh let 's see . yeah . you can move to the next slide , so . so the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . i have some kind of pictures you know , here . you have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff so and the next slide , it is the last one it 's so it 's i think it should be wire wireless re remote con because you know , it 's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , i at my side prefer a wireless . marketing : what 's the average price of this technology then ?

there 's a wire with remote control ? industrial designer : you 'd yes , you can . it 's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it 's it 's a question that we can raise , so . we can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . we can have both also . project manager : so you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the tv wo n't be a good idea . no it wou maybe it will be cheaper i dunno , i just may maybe you making a solu yeah , i 'm just asking you . do you think it will be cheaper ?

<s> summarize the discussion about the industrial design of the product . </s> marketing : so , i dunno , it 's maybe difficult to have both , i mean the the one on the right does n't look so simple project manager : you mean this one ? yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , i suppose . user interface : it take less time for user to learn how to use it . industrial designer : yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . project manager : oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . powerful and easy to use . yeah , that 's the point . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or so we can move to the next slide . as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one i h i 'm holding in my hand and the tv . so , this one is leather bu based but i propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me i think that it is better it 's bet it 's better to control tv i have some kind of pictures you know , here . you have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . user interface : so what , the wireless remote control ?

<s> what did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing the problem of having less buttons ? </s> project manager : so you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful . marketing : i mean the the one on the right does n't look so simple industrial designer : but but this is user interface : but if we have very very good user interface marketing : and then project manager : oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? industrial designer : so you have to the sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that so . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . marketing : so that 's the point . user interface : yeah , that 's the point . industrial designer : okay , okay . the rationale must be design , or and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . marketing : that might just so . industrial designer : look . but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . user interface : wireless remote control . project manager : but yeah but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? industrial designer : okay , yeah . marketing : uh that 's my job . that 's the project manager : yeah . just think of the problem . if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? i think it 's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , marketing : well that 's actually one of the point , yeah ? true . yeah , the the look is is bad for them r_s_i_ is like , when you 're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . and definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , user interface : yeah , i think possible . because we can we can uh mix uh several function in one button . so lets you then you have less buttons . but i 'm not sure project manager : because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . i think the marketing : it 's user interface : no you you can have a switch menu , so you can project manager : yeah , but it has to be intuitive . yeah , okay . okay , user interface : then you you put the switch button , project manager : but user interface : then it switch to another category of functions . yeah . for example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your tv and also you can control your uh recorder . industrial designer : with a user interface : so there 's a different functions , but i if you you there 's a button you can switch between control tv and control your recorder . so we can has less buttons . but what i 'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . industrial designer : yeah , yeah , yeah . user interface : some people prefer black remote control . project manager : and also f user interface : so user can select which colour they prefer , so . project manager : so i think you have quite lot of points to to think about marketing : yeah , it 's done , just yeah . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it . project manager : mm-hmm . okay . mm so so , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , it 's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . is it okay ? user interface : okay . but there 's balance between function and the cost . project manager : so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . but marketing : i do n't think it 's part of the remote control design anyway . project manager : maybe not , industrial designer : it 's pop i do n't think it 's popular , so that 's the problem so . you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know user interface : so i i so as as for the colour , what what do you think ? okay . okay . project manager : so you have to user interface : okay , okay . okay . project manager : because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . it 's okay ? marketing : regarding the first line , what so we 're just expecting no more use of the teletext . industrial designer : but i dunno , but why , nobody 's a threat to me . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about product appearance . </s> industrial designer : industrial design . david jordan ? mm-hmm . user interface : mm yeah . marketing : mm-hmm . project manager : so i 'll i let david jordan do his presentation . marketing : no , no . uh this one does n't want to be moved , i think . user interface : uh i i will focus on user interface design . um so move to the next slide . as we know our remote c rem remote tv control it 's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . there 's a lot of functions . over , i think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote tv control . so how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? um , let 's move to next slide . um . yeah . so i so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . a very good example is google . as we know uh google it 's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . um so move to next s slide . so my job is to uh design a google tv controller which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . so project manager : many functions and very easy to use . user interface : but if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it . project manager : oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? marketing : yeah , that 's gon na be the trick . user interface : yeah , that 's my job . industrial designer : that 's your job project manager : so , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things . industrial designer : the rationale must be design , or how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one i h i 'm holding in my hand and the tv . so , this one is leather bu based i think it 's cheaper than laser , so . yeah , i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it 's better to have uh uh let 's see . yeah . you can move to the next slide , so . so the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . look . but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . user interface : so what , the wireless remote control ? there 's a wire with remote control ? wireless remote control . project manager : i think it 's more your problem . mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . marketing : uh that 's my job . that 's the user interface : design a wireless remote control . industrial designer : okay . marketing : which is participant four . so just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . we 've made a study , so could you go to next slide . okay . so then it 's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that 's project manager : you mean the loo the look , the outside ? marketing : yeah , the the look is is bad for them project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . project manager : marketing : so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , i think . um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . and uh remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . project manager : what is r_s_i_ ? marketing : r_s_i_ is like , when you 're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : ah um okay . marketing : okay ? so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . so last slide . um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : this would definitely be a good way of selling more . okay . user interface : but what i 'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . because different people have a different opinion about fancy . you know . some people prefer black remote control . project manager : and we do n't really want the price to be too too high , because we wan na be able to produce it . so , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it 's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . marketing : yeah , it 's done , just yeah . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it . project manager : so , i had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we do n't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it 's something that 's user interface : mm-hmm . yeah . project manager : it 's which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we ca n't do that . we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . is it okay ? and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . i mean that 's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it 's our product . user interface : mm-hm . project manager : yeah . as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , 'cause what i 'm thinking is how will you will connect the tv to internet , so . it 's pop i do n't think it 's popular , so that 's the problem so . you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know user interface : so i i so as as for the colour , what what do you think ? project manager : why you go it has to be fashion . yeah . it has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . just when you enter you say oh , oh , it 's real reaction . think it 's a re reaction remote control , so . industrial designer : but i dunno , but why , nobody 's a threat to me . </s>

industrial designer : so you have to the sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that so . yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the google system to the system , alright . marketing : so that 's the point . user interface : yeah , that 's the point . project manager : so , next i propose the industrial user interface to present things . industrial designer : okay , okay . the rationale must be design , or how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one i h i 'm holding in my hand and the tv . so , this one is leather bu based project manager : so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?

there 's a wire with remote control ? industrial designer : you 'd yes , you can . it 's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it 's it 's a question that we can raise , so . we can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . we can have both also . project manager : yeah but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? i think it 's more your problem . mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . user interface : mm-hmm . design a wireless remote control . project manager : yeah . just think of the problem . if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?

<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> user interface : and i guess the only other thing that we really did n't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . how how so industrial designer : yeah we did n't design that . user interface : yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . project manager : oh . um if you wan na look in your project documents folder , there 's an excel spreadsheet . um the only one that 's in there , production costs . and if you open it up . um i 've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . but if i missed anything that we 've gone over , or if you see something that has changed well yeah . if we 're talking about the area just oh i d i dunno . i guess we 'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . marketing : yeah it 's in the um it 's in the project documents . and it 's under evaluation . yeah . you 've found it all ? project manager : um we can do it separately and then discuss it user interface : so it 's actually a scale . project manager : so these are the questions we 're answering . and one is marketing : yes ? very very true . okay . project manager : un unless you feel you need it t to marketing : really ? industrial designer : i thought it was the other way round too . project manager : so we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way industrial designer : sh yeah i i was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . marketing : or is it tedious ? i 'm i 'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . project manager : that was material . user interface : what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? project manager : i mean what if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . marketing : yeah . project manager : or i mean we could even have fruit like around but if we if we need yeah . and if we wan na incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be user interface : or like i dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like industrial designer : we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . project manager : but i mean it do we have any other ideas about that ? marketing : um user interface : we could tr i do n't know . we were a bit off task . um so uh i ca n't think of any so we 'll have to like mm . yeah i dunno . you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , project manager : mm . not really well we 've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . um so project evaluation . i guess we 're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it 's alright . uh . yeah . um did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of user interface : i did . the prototype making was very creatively stimulating and i think we 've come up with a product that 's fun and meets all the criteria . project manager : and how was our leadership and teamwork ? industrial designer : i think it was good . we knew what we were doing . it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . well you told us when to start and when to end , and that 's all that matters . project manager : yeah , well i 'm never gon na do a management position , i know that now . user interface : you did a good job leading . marketing : yeah we did n't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . user interface : yeah i think it more than anything we did n't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like i do n't know , all had ideas about it but project manager : um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , i mean we used industrial designer : well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . i just use the unix or the off market , sort of wordperfect and all these other things . yeah . well the problem is if you do n't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it . so i have all these documents i ca n't use now . but yeah i mean i guess it 's okay . user interface : i felt like my i dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . but there 's kinda it was kinda like okay , i do n't really think i dunno what i 'm doing here . so i did n't really think it was helpful . so i kind of just made up my own stuff and i did n't really like the powerpoint presentations , but yeah i d i do n't really like powerpoint personally , think it 's kinda stupid . project manager : i ca n't say i found everything particularly helpful . like i really ? marketing : no mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful i think . i think it depends on the role project manager : 'cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they 'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? see i could n't do that , so i did n't really know what you guys were doing . and when you were talking about it i was just like marketing : yeah . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system , industrial designer : it seems planned you know . user interface : yeah i kinda thought that um i felt like i would go and like try to use my information , or like i 'd make this stupid little presentation and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated i dunno i felt like i was off-task all the time . but um project manager : well i mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it was n't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? oh right . given certain information or just marketing : i do n't have a clue , anyway . project manager : mm , mm . what do you guys think of the pens ? industrial designer : they 're pretty cool . but even so , i dunno . project manager : and new ideas found ? marketing : yeah it 's all very new , no ? it 's all very new . user interface : yeah i dunno . but they 're they 're okay . industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : uh i think , and i think that uh all this technology like i guess some people must be interested in using it but i ca n't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone 's notes , industrial designer : well the thing is , like i actually worked in a company , and i had a role and i had to go to meetings . and like the last thing i would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause i missed a meeting . like usually i missed meetings deliberately . there 's just there 's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you 're actually at a real meeting in a real company . and you 're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who 's sort of on task should already know . it 's like the there 's just really not a lot of information that goes through . project manager : seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . industrial designer : it seems like way overkill . like if i missed a meeting i could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . i would n't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and user interface : i guess it would be it 's got ta be worth it to i 'cause i 'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause ca n't really imagine , dunno . how about a p a ? project manager : well does anyone wan na talk about fruit more while we still have time ? any other ideas for marketing : what what 's the end ? are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report ? or we ending ? project manager : um we still have time if there 's any other input . i mean the i think we did really well personally , which is why we 've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'cause i mean we 've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it 's trendy . marketing : okay we have to fill in all this stuff . stuff stuff stuff . industrial designer : i think i 've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about detailed design of the remote control . </s> industrial designer : okay well um . so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu . and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . and it comes user interface : yeah . it 's been a l industrial designer : mm-hmm . user interface : and i guess the only other thing that we really did n't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . how how so okay so that 's just so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . industrial designer : but it would be coordinating with that of course . user interface : yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : mm-hmm . project manager : i mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button . um i said uncurved or flat . i think that 's what you have there , is that right ? for the for the plastic part would be industrial designer : my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . project manager : oh . okay . right . well yeah . if we 're talking about the area just oh i d i dunno . i guess we 'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . um so what else ? there 's plastic for that area around the button . um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? industrial designer : no i think that 's alright . project manager : boo yeah . okay . s so mm . did y what did you work on ? the okay . do you wan na okay . i think that 's marketing : um so the que the questions i 've given you c could you write that down ? true is one and and false is seven . and we 'll just go through each point together , hopefully . um . i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . i dunno how it works exactly , i have n't been told . user interface : yeah . is it possible that we can bring this up on our own marketing : yeah . you 've found it all ? project manager : one , right okay . industrial designer : sh yeah i i was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . marketing : right so i put one on that . okay i 'll um i 'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . project manager : no no that 's um i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wan na discuss changing an aspect of the remote . user interface : and like then it you could hold it in your hand better . industrial designer : i think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . they 're kinda smallish . project manager : yeah . no but i imagine even if it was bigger , like if it 's round and it 's big then you you ca n't get that 's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : the flat one . yeah . project manager : what if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . i dunno . project manager : but if we if we need yeah . and if we wan na incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be user interface : yeah . 'cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that 's uncomfortable obviously . or like i dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : so like maybe that 's just too big project manager : well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of user interface : yeah it 's sorta like a joystick . marketing : yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . alright . industrial designer : that everyone gave that a one or a two . yeah they 'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . yeah um like on a normal remote . so it would probably either in the f no it ca n't be in the front 'cause the i_r_ 's right there , but it 'd be on one of the sides probably . project manager : okay . marketing : so i think it 's yeah those are the only two points . industrial designer : yeah i 'd agree with changing the shape . project manager : okay . user interface : yeah i dunno . you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , yeah . yeah that 's true . mm . i did . project manager : um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , i mean we used industrial designer : well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . project manager : are you a mac person ? marketing : which is n't very user-friendly though . project manager : yeah . yeah . user interface : but yeah i d i do n't really like powerpoint personally , think it 's kinda stupid . project manager : i ca n't say i found everything particularly helpful . like i user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : it industrial designer : my first bit of information was like this child 's drawn picture of how a remote works . marketing : i think it depends on the role project manager : yeah , yeah . marketing : yeah . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um yeah , yeah . no . project manager : mm , mm . industrial designer : but even so , i dunno . marketing : yeah it 's all very new , no ? it 's all very new . user interface : i think the microphones are okay when you 're sitting down , but like they 're kinda clumsy i guess when you 're like when you 're s going up to the whiteboard like . industrial designer : oh yeah . well they drop off if you like move too much . user interface : yeah i dunno . but they 're they 're okay . industrial designer : i do n't know . it 's like the there 's just really not a lot of information that goes through . project manager : seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . industrial designer : it seems like way overkill . project manager : yeah . industrial designer : i would n't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and project manager : yeah . well does anyone wan na talk about fruit more while we still have time ? any other ideas for um we still have time if there 's any other input . </s>

<s> summarize the discussion about the process of the project . </s> project manager : 'kay . hmm . okay everybody . welcome to the detailed design meeting . um let 's see . our agenda . last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . um and i think looks like we 've come up with some ideas . um and we also talked about materials we 'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . um so for later in the meeting i 've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we 'll take a look at that . um and see if it 's changed at all from when we last discussed it . um so actually i think yeah um f you guys wan na give a prototype presentation of marketing : project manager : user interface : and i guess the only other thing that we really did n't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . how how so yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . project manager : oh . um if you wan na look in your project documents folder , there 's an excel spreadsheet . um the only one that 's in there , production costs . and if you open it up . um i 've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . but if i missed anything that we 've gone over , or if you see something that has changed industrial designer : project manager : and if we sold a lot of squishy things . boo yeah . okay . s so mm . did y what did you work on ? the marketing : um evaluation criteria . i 've got a presentation . so i need where 's the cable ? right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we 've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . um . right . this does n't okay . um the method is we well i 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything 's listed down . um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . these are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . we have to use a table , i 'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . i would like to show you the table we have to use . um . no . this is the table . can you see this here ? industrial designer : mm-hmm . marketing : um so the que the questions i 've given you c could you write that down ? true is one and and false is seven . and we 'll just go through each point together , hopefully . um . i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . industrial designer : marketing : i dunno how it works exactly , i have n't been told . user interface : yeah . is it possible that we can bring this up on our own marketing : yeah it 's in the um it 's in the project documents . do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? project manager : um we can do it separately and then discuss it un unless you feel you need it t to i was n't cheating i swear . industrial designer : i thought it was the other way round too . marketing : right , well i 'm glad this came out . industrial designer : i thought you guys hated it . marketing : okay i 'll um i 'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . or is it tedious ? i 'm i 'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . industrial designer : we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . um , i was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . user interface : we were a bit off task . project manager : mm . not really well we 've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . um so project evaluation . i guess we 're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it 's alright . uh . yeah . user interface : the prototype making was very creatively stimulating and i think we 've come up with a product that 's fun and meets all the criteria . project manager : and how was our leadership and teamwork ? industrial designer : i think it was good . we knew what we were doing . it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . project manager : well i thought my leadership was crap personally . industrial designer : well you told us when to start and when to end , and that 's all that matters . project manager : excuse me , am i allowed to say that ? yeah . um . user interface : i think you were fine . project manager : yeah , well i 'm never gon na do a management position , i know that now . user interface : you did a good job leading . project manager : um yeah , i thought we all worked very well together . user interface : yeah i think it more than anything we did n't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like i do n't know , all had ideas about it but industrial designer : marketing : project manager : um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , industrial designer : well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . project manager : are you a mac person ? marketing : industrial designer : i just use the unix or the off market , sort of wordperfect and all these other things . project manager : industrial designer : yeah . well the problem is if you do n't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it . so i have all these documents i ca n't use now . but yeah i mean i guess it 's okay . user interface : i felt like my i dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . but there 's kinda it was kinda like okay , i do n't really think i dunno what i 'm doing here . industrial designer : user interface : so i did n't really think it was helpful . so i kind of just made up my own stuff and i did n't really like the powerpoint presentations , so i kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . but yeah i d i do n't really like powerpoint personally , think it 's kinda stupid . project manager : i ca n't say i found everything particularly helpful . like i marketing : i though it was brilliant no ? no mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful i think . project manager : 'cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they 'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? see i could n't do that , so i did n't really know what you guys were doing . and when you were talking about it i was just like marketing : yeah . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um industrial designer : well i think it 's interesting how it all went together , like i had the stuff about how me how rubber 's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and it seems planned you know . user interface : yeah i kinda thought that um i felt like i would go and like try to use my information , or like i 'd make this stupid little presentation and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated i dunno i felt like i was off-task all the time . but um project manager : well i mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it was n't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ?

industrial designer : i think it was good . we knew what we were doing . it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . project manager : well i thought my leadership was crap personally . industrial designer : well you told us when to start and when to end , and that 's all that matters . project manager : excuse me , am i allowed to say that ? yeah . um . user interface : i think you were fine . project manager : yeah , well i 'm never gon na do a management position , i know that now . user interface : you did a good job leading . project manager : um yeah , i thought we all worked very well together . marketing : yeah we did n't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . user interface : yeah i think it more than anything we did n't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like i do n't know , all had ideas about it but project manager : um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , i mean we used industrial designer : well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . i just use the unix or the off market , sort of wordperfect and all these other things . marketing : which is n't very user-friendly though . industrial designer : yeah . well the problem is if you do n't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it . so i have all these documents i ca n't use now . but yeah i mean i guess it 's okay . user interface : i felt like my i dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . but there 's kinda it was kinda like okay , i do n't really think i dunno what i 'm doing here . so i did n't really think it was helpful . so i kind of just made up my own stuff and i did n't really like the powerpoint presentations , project manager : yeah . user interface : so i kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . project manager : yeah . user interface : but yeah i d i do n't really like powerpoint personally , think it 's kinda stupid . project manager : i ca n't say i found everything particularly helpful . like i user interface : yeah . industrial designer : yeah . my first bit of information was like this child 's drawn picture of how a remote works . marketing : no mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful i think . i think it depends on the role project manager : 'cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they 'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? see i could n't do that , so i did n't really know what you guys were doing . and when you were talking about it i was just like marketing : yeah . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system , industrial designer : well i think it 's interesting how it all went together , like i had the stuff about how me how rubber 's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and it seems planned you know . user interface : yeah i kinda thought that um i felt like i would go and like try to use my information , or like i 'd make this stupid little presentation and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because i dunno i felt like i was off-task all the time . but um project manager : well i mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it was n't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? marketing : but i think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . project manager : oh right . given certain information or just marketing : yeah , like if everyone 's given the same input industrial designer : but even so , i dunno . project manager : and new ideas found ? marketing : no ? it 's all very new . user interface : i think the microphones are okay when you 're sitting down , but like they 're kinda clumsy i guess when you 're like when you 're s going up to the whiteboard like . industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : uh i think , and i think that uh all this technology like i guess some people must be interested in using it but i ca n't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone 's notes , industrial designer : well the thing is , like i actually worked in a company , and i had a role and i had to go to meetings . and like the last thing i would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause i missed a meeting . like usually i missed meetings deliberately . there 's just there 's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you 're actually at a real meeting in a real company . it 's mostly like rehashing old stuff . and you 're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who 's sort of on task should already know . it 's like the there 's just really not a lot of information that goes through . project manager : seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . industrial designer : it seems like way overkill . i would n't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and user interface : i guess it would be it 's got ta be worth it to i 'cause i 'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause ca n't really imagine , dunno . how about a p a ? project manager : well does anyone wan na talk about fruit more while we still have time ? any other ideas for marketing : what what 's the end ? are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report ? or we ending ? project manager : um we still have time if there 's any other input . i mean the i think we did really well personally , which is why we 've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'cause i mean we 've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it 's trendy . </s>
<s> what did the group think of the convenience of presentation materials ? </s> industrial designer : okay well um . so our design looks something like this . this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu . and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . and it comes user interface : you could change the vegetable , or fruit . it 's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it 's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it 's not too big . uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . and i guess the only other thing that we really did n't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . how how so industrial designer : well the locator is just chip that 's inside there . user interface : okay so that 's just so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the industrial designer : yeah we did n't design that . user interface : yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . industrial designer : but it would be coordinating with that of course . project manager : i mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button . um i said uncurved or flat . i think that 's what you have there , is that right ? for the for the plastic part would be industrial designer : my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . but it 's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d i dunno what that means . project manager : well yeah . if we 're talking about the area just oh i d i dunno . i guess we 'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we 'd be making even more of a profit . and if we sold a lot of squishy things . user interface : yeah . is it possible that we can bring this up on our own so it 's actually a scale . marketing : um , project manager : so these are the questions we 're answering . and one is marketing : they should n't really be questions . should be more like are the batteries easy to insert ? project manager : un unless you feel you need it t to industrial designer : wait a minute . sh yeah i i was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . marketing : two . four point two . right so i put one on that . project manager : no no that 's um i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wan na discuss changing an aspect of the remote . user interface : what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? industrial designer : i think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . they 're kinda smallish . project manager : i mean user interface : i think we need n't project manager : what if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . user interface : yeah . that could work . project manager : or i mean we could even have fruit like around user interface : yeah . i dunno . project manager : but if we if we need marketing : yeah and just have the colour match or something . project manager : yeah . and if we wan na incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be mm . user interface : or like i dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like so like maybe that 's just too big project manager : well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of user interface : yeah it 's sorta like a joystick . project manager : i mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? user interface : yeah . yeah . alright . project manager : no you could just like any other one . okay . yeah . marketing : so i think it 's yeah those are the only two points . industrial designer : yeah i 'd agree with changing the shape . user interface : um so uh i ca n't think of any so we 'll have to like mm . yeah i dunno . you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , industrial designer : i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . user interface : i did . industrial designer : sponginess . user interface : and i think we 've come up with a product that 's fun and meets all the criteria . project manager : excuse me , am i allowed to say that ? yeah . um . yeah , well i 'm never gon na do a management position , i know that now . marketing : yeah we did n't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . user interface : no . project manager : um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? like the the pens , the whiteboard , i mean we used industrial designer : well i 'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . project manager : are you a mac person ? marketing : which is n't very user-friendly though . industrial designer : yeah . well the problem is if you do n't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it . so i have all these documents i ca n't use now . but yeah i mean i guess it 's okay . user interface : but yeah i d i do n't really like powerpoint personally , think it 's kinda stupid . industrial designer : yeah . i never use it . project manager : it really ? marketing : i think it depends on the role project manager : 'cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they 'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? industrial designer : yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . marketing : yeah . but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system , project manager : yeah . user interface : yeah i kinda thought that um i felt like i would go and like try to use my information , or like i 'd make this stupid little presentation and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because marketing : no . project manager : so it 's industrial designer : if i had n't been told that fruit was project manager : oh right . given certain information or just mm , mm . industrial designer : they 're pretty cool . project manager : and i i 've f forgotten once or twice to check the box . industrial designer : but even so , i dunno . marketing : no ? it 's all very new . user interface : yeah i think i 'd like to um i dunno . like it was the yeah i dunno . but they 're they 're okay . industrial designer : i do n't know . user interface : uh i think , and i think that uh all this technology like i guess some people must be interested in using it but i ca n't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone 's notes , or like i dunno . industrial designer : it 's like the there 's just really not a lot of information that goes through . project manager : seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . industrial designer : it seems like way overkill . user interface : i guess it would be it 's got ta be worth it to i 'cause i 'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause ca n't really imagine , dunno . how about a p a ? um i dunno . project manager : well does anyone wan na talk about fruit more while we still have time ? </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . well , if you remember , we have the four purposes , and then we have the areas of learning and experience , and then , below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience . so , we 're going to be refining some of those . some of the feedback that we 've had is that— suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . sian gwenllian am : —actually implemented in september— kirsty williams am : and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . hefin david am : can i ask what value you place on the work done by the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by dr nigel newton ? so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' kirsty williams am : well , i think the last time we had this conversation in the committee i said that i think the comments that the wlga and adew had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date , and i think progress had been made in that time , and i 'm pleased to report the significant progress that 's been made— bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . okay . so , i think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the scottish curriculum , but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen . so , i think it 's fair to say—and i spent time with some delegates from scotland just this weekend at the atlantic rim collaboratory conference that wales hosted this year . unfortunately , minister swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of brexit preparedness work that he was involved in , but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the ewc in scotland joined us as well as representatives from the scottish government , although not john himself , and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum . part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought— . they spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment . assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in . professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes , i think they would agree that that was n't necessarily— . the middle tier , which they do n't have to the— . well , they 've got local authorities and regions , but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing . so , i think we 've learned— . although our curriculum is n't a copycat , as i said , we have been able to learn from , and we 've had people who have been deeply involved in the scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we 've had in terms of developing coherence . but , steve , i do n't know if— . you speak to your scottish colleagues quite a lot . the particular focus of this year 's conference was on the issue of assessment and we were joined by colleagues from scotland , from ireland , from iceland , from finland , from saskatchewan , from nova scotia and from uruguay . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . lynne neagle am : thank you . we 've got a lot of issues to cover , so i 'm going to appeal for concise questions , concise answers . on to assessment , progression and accountability—suzy . suzy davies am : obviously , we 're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well . presumably , the way you 're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate , and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be— . they 're out in a separate document ; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document—is that right ? there 's a thick black line between these two concepts . right . i accept that . is it realistic , then , to expect parents , families , communities , not to think about that information when they 're drawing conclusions about the school , notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately ? okay . i understand that . so , how— ? can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability , on both sides of that thick black line—the methodology—is likely to change with this ? you mentioned that there 's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly ; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation . without pre-empting the findings of such a review , have you got your top three likely expected changes ? kirsty williams am : to accountability ? yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . suzy davies am : i do n't think i 've quite followed that journey . because i get the point of the end point being estyn , and that 's where the public assurance will be seen , but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards ? where will we see those demonstrated ? kirsty williams am : well , i 'd absolutely agree with qualifications wales . the qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum , and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum . qualifications wales , which i met with yesterday , i think—yes , yesterday ; it seems a long time ago—will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in november . sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . sian gwenllian am : i get that . that 's why i do n't understand why we 're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the pisa . but , i understand . janet finch-saunders am : how will you monitor it ? no , but through the systems and mechanisms in place . kirsty williams am : well , as we 've just said , ultimately , we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia , nor are we getting rid of estyn . so , one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that estyn would make to a school . </s>
<s> what were the specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum that would be included in the primary legislation ? </s> lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , minister . you said that you 're reflecting on the messages that you 've received . are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance ? kirsty williams am : i think what 's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession , we are doing it with our profession . so , in the spirit of co-construction , the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present . so , members will be aware that we 've slightly changed the model . we had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now . pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward , and we 've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools . but above and beyond the innovative schools , we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas , and they 're the first part of that process . so , they met last week to begin looking at the feedback , and we 'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine . are there big changes to the concept ? no . opportunities to do things better , explain things better , simplify where possible , where we 've been told that that needs to happen , provide greater depth where we 've been told that needs to happen—absolutely . we 're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those , but in terms of the overall concept , then no , no significant changes . sian gwenllian am : you 've touched on the point that there 's going to be some sort of change , and you 've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation . we want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind . kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . well , if you remember , we have the four purposes , and then we have the areas of learning and experience , and then , below the areas of learning and experience are the broad concepts that we would expect to be delivered in each of those areas of learning and experience . so , we 're going to be refining some of those . some of the feedback that we 've had is that— adding is not necessarily—no , not adding . but , for instance , the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience . so , they 'll be refined , but not added to , and then we will legislate for them , and that had n't been the original intention . lynne neagle am : they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : moving on , therefore , to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education , i understand that you 've had numerous responses to the white paper surrounding this particular area . what are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what 's been said ? kirsty williams am : yes . claire , would you say that it was a co-ordinated response ? and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . hefin david am : what the wiserd research suggests is that the senior management teams—the management teams—would certainly buy into what you 've just said , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' kirsty williams am : i don't— . i do not believe that any changes—and i would not pursue any changes that—would lead to a segregation . bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . claire bennett : i think , as we move forward , that kind of cluster approach remains really important . so , it 's , as schools then think about , 'what am i going to do in my school ? ' , that they 're doing that in clusters together . when colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week , they were talking about the very specific and differentiated , i suppose , professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out . their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support , so people are n't just going off in isolation . the other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network . so , there 'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience , bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development , bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed . so , i think that a huge amount of thinking , particularly in the regions , has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools , not just in engaging with the curriculum now , but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools . it feels like—i think graham donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process ' . you do n't start in 2022—people are already doing it and there 's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years . kirsty williams am : i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . yes . i mean , it 's early thoughts , because we 've only just heard about it ourselves . but that 's the beauty of working with other countries . they found that particular useful and successful , and we 're keen to see if we could do something similar . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . okay . so , all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase , which is innovation schools , and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within welsh government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us , going forward . i think one of the lessons learned , and this was said in the committee , was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools , but there was a downside to having pioneer schools , and i think , at this stage of the game , we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now—everybody had to be a pioneer—because this is coming down the track and we do n't want anybody just sitting there waiting until september 2022 and saying , 'oh , gosh . i 've got to do something new today ' . not that they would have done that , but— . so , the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we 've all got to engage in this now . the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement , and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues . steve . claire bennett : yes . so , during the first term of work , we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so , take the whole curriculum guidance and then think , 'how would i apply that in the school ? , does it make sense ? , can we work with it ? , what are the issues ? , what are the questions that arise for us for assessment ? ' , and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on , 'if i were putting this into practice— ' . so , it 's slightly different to the feedback we 've had from other people , which has been more , 'maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording ' and kind of quite practical , and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school . that 's been drawn together into an overall report , drawing out the themes , by wavehill , who are a kind of research company . it 's been really useful , and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week . having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable , in just making us think , even with all the practitioners that have been involved , 'how do we make this work for schools ? ' , given that we 've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically . so , it 's been invaluable , and they 're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we 're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically . kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . suzy davies am : i do n't think i 've quite followed that journey . because i get the point of the end point being estyn , and that 's where the public assurance will be seen , but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards ? where will we see those demonstrated ? sian gwenllian am : with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . oh gosh , that shows that siân thinks that i 'll be here to make that decision . [ laughter . ] that 's very encouraging indeed . [ laughter . ] steve davies : one very quick technical point , chair . we have not opted out of this . countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it , and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this . </s>
<s> what would be added to the legislation ? </s> lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , minister . you said that you 're reflecting on the messages that you 've received . are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance ? kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ?

suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . kirsty williams am : we 're assuming so . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : moving on , therefore , to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education , i understand that you 've had numerous responses to the white paper surrounding this particular area . what are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what 's been said ? kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . hefin david am : so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' kirsty williams am : i don't— . i do not believe that any changes—and i would not pursue any changes that—would lead to a segregation . bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . suzy davies am : so , on the basis that this is not about assessment , you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment . can you tell me a little bit about what you 've learned about how they quality control the content , even though the content , of course , will be completely different in wales ? kirsty williams am : i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ?

' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . suzy davies am : obviously , we 're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well . presumably , the way you 're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate , and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be— . they 're out in a separate document ; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document—is that right ? there 's a thick black line between these two concepts . okay . well , just finally on that , there may be an argument , then , for scrapping categorisation , putting something else in place . but i suppose the core question is : how are the general public going to understand all those things that you 've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach , the leaders being able to lead , and how well a school is performing against kpis on those measures ? kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . suzy davies am : i do n't think i 've quite followed that journey . because i get the point of the end point being estyn , and that 's where the public assurance will be seen , but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards ? where will we see those demonstrated ? sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about the 'what matters ' ? </s> lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , minister . you said that you 're reflecting on the messages that you 've received . are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance ? kirsty williams am : i think what 's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession , we are doing it with our profession . so , in the spirit of co-construction , the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present . so , members will be aware that we 've slightly changed the model . we had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now . pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward , and we 've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools . but above and beyond the innovative schools , we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas , and they 're the first part of that process . so , they met last week to begin looking at the feedback , and we 'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine . are there big changes to the concept ? no . opportunities to do things better , explain things better , simplify where possible , where we 've been told that that needs to happen , provide greater depth where we 've been told that needs to happen—absolutely . we 're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those , but in terms of the overall concept , then no , no significant changes . sian gwenllian am : you 've touched on the point that there 's going to be some sort of change , and you 've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation . we want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind . kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : moving on , therefore , to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education , i understand that you 've had numerous responses to the white paper surrounding this particular area . what are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what 's been said ? kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . sian gwenllian am : okay , thank you . you 've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year . what is the timetable for the bill itself and for seeking royal assent for that ? kirsty williams am : and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . hefin david am : can i ask what value you place on the work done by the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by dr nigel newton ? so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' kirsty williams am : well , i think the last time we had this conversation in the committee i said that i think the comments that the wlga and adew had made were reflective of an old piece of work and were not current and up to date , and i think progress had been made in that time , and i 'm pleased to report the significant progress that 's been made— bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . okay . so , i think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the scottish curriculum , but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen . so , i think it 's fair to say—and i spent time with some delegates from scotland just this weekend at the atlantic rim collaboratory conference that wales hosted this year . unfortunately , minister swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of brexit preparedness work that he was involved in , but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the ewc in scotland joined us as well as representatives from the scottish government , although not john himself , and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum . part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought— . they spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment . assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in . professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes , i think they would agree that that was n't necessarily— . the middle tier , which they do n't have to the— . well , they 've got local authorities and regions , but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing . so , i think we 've learned— . although our curriculum is n't a copycat , as i said , we have been able to learn from , and we 've had people who have been deeply involved in the scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we 've had in terms of developing coherence . but , steve , i do n't know if— . you speak to your scottish colleagues quite a lot . steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . claire bennett : i think , as we move forward , that kind of cluster approach remains really important . so , it 's , as schools then think about , 'what am i going to do in my school ? ' , that they 're doing that in clusters together . when colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week , they were talking about the very specific and differentiated , i suppose , professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out . their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support , so people are n't just going off in isolation . the other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network . so , there 'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience , bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development , bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed . so , i think that a huge amount of thinking , particularly in the regions , has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools , not just in engaging with the curriculum now , but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools . it feels like—i think graham donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process ' . you do n't start in 2022—people are already doing it and there 's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years . lynne neagle am : very quickly , because i want to move on to implementation . kirsty williams am : there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . okay . so , all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase , which is innovation schools , and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within welsh government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us , going forward . i think one of the lessons learned , and this was said in the committee , was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools , but there was a downside to having pioneer schools , and i think , at this stage of the game , we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now—everybody had to be a pioneer—because this is coming down the track and we do n't want anybody just sitting there waiting until september 2022 and saying , 'oh , gosh . i 've got to do something new today ' . not that they would have done that , but— . so , the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we 've all got to engage in this now . the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement , and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues . steve . claire bennett : yes . so , during the first term of work , we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so , take the whole curriculum guidance and then think , 'how would i apply that in the school ? , does it make sense ? , can we work with it ? , what are the issues ? , what are the questions that arise for us for assessment ? ' , and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on , 'if i were putting this into practice— ' . so , it 's slightly different to the feedback we 've had from other people , which has been more , 'maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording ' and kind of quite practical , and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school . that 's been drawn together into an overall report , drawing out the themes , by wavehill , who are a kind of research company . it 's been really useful , and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week . having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable , in just making us think , even with all the practitioners that have been involved , 'how do we make this work for schools ? ' , given that we 've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically . so , it 's been invaluable , and they 're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we 're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically . kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . suzy davies am : i do n't think i 've quite followed that journey . because i get the point of the end point being estyn , and that 's where the public assurance will be seen , but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards ? where will we see those demonstrated ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . okay . just on the welsh dimension , i think it 's really important that whatever resources we have to support the welsh dimension are really , really , really broad and not confined to specific areas . i was in swansea university just this week , looking at some of their technocamp work that they 're doing to help us with coding , and we had an amazing conversation about the welsh contribution to the computing industry . and so my expectation is that that is n't taught in a history lesson—that , actually , when children are learning about coding , they get to hear that welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology . so , that's— . when i talk about a welsh dimension , i mean right the way across the curriculum , and i think that 's important . with regard to— . the continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught . we have to recognise— . we have to recognise that , and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in welsh language and in the english language , and they have to be contextualised . we recognise that children learning welsh in a welsh-medium school , their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker , and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning welsh in an english-medium school . vice versa—we 've had this discussion before—if a child is going into welsh medium , their progression in english perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an english-medium school , although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position . so , we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school , but recognising that it is a progression . it is n't a start and never get any further . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . oh gosh , that shows that siân thinks that i 'll be here to make that decision . [ laughter . ] that 's very encouraging indeed . [ laughter . ] steve davies : one very quick technical point , chair . we have not opted out of this . countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it , and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this . </s>
<s> what value the government placed on different sectors ? </s> kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . lynne neagle am : they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . i always—and welsh government are big supporters of wiserd and the work that they do , and , in fact , we need more research into welsh education , not less . therefore , i find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work . i think what 's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that i hope that , in the time where i 've had an influence to influence over welsh education , either as a backbencher or now as a minister , equality and principles of equity have always driven what i 've tried to achieve . and i would never undertake a policy reform that i thought would lead to less equity in the welsh education system . closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap . bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? kirsty williams am : yes . i mean , it 's early thoughts , because we 've only just heard about it ourselves . but that 's the beauty of working with other countries . they found that particular useful and successful , and we 're keen to see if we could do something similar . you 're right , first of all , it 's not an insignificant amount ; it 's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . so , you 're right that it is not insignificant , and it was a hard-won resource , i can tell you , from my colleagues . because , as i said earlier , the curriculum itself can be amazing , but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it , then all this change will be for nothing . so , investing in the profession is absolutely crucial . that money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think , 'what are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school ? ' because , as we 've just heard from claire , there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain . there are other schools that maybe are only beginning now , now that it 's published , to be really engaging with the curriculum . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . dawn bowden am : okay . and the money that you announced for this professional development preparation , if you like , was for two years . so , there 's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development , as well as anything else . but is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you 've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues ? or do you see what you 've put in as being , 'this is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation . the rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that ' ? kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . suzy davies am : obviously , we 're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well . presumably , the way you 're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate , and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be— . they 're out in a separate document ; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document—is that right ? there 's a thick black line between these two concepts . kirsty williams am : yes , absolutely . i think some of the trouble that we 've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability , and , when you start using assessment for accountability purposes , that 's when , potentially , that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming . oh , yes . and that should be the purpose for assessment . the primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child 's educational journey on , and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents , whether they 're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment . so , absolutely , you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods , whichever type they use , with parents , to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child . suzy davies am : okay . well , just finally on that , there may be an argument , then , for scrapping categorisation , putting something else in place . but i suppose the core question is : how are the general public going to understand all those things that you 've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach , the leaders being able to lead , and how well a school is performing against kpis on those measures ? kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? kirsty williams am : okay . just on the welsh dimension , i think it 's really important that whatever resources we have to support the welsh dimension are really , really , really broad and not confined to specific areas . i was in swansea university just this week , looking at some of their technocamp work that they 're doing to help us with coding , and we had an amazing conversation about the welsh contribution to the computing industry . and so my expectation is that that is n't taught in a history lesson—that , actually , when children are learning about coding , they get to hear that welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology . so , that's— . when i talk about a welsh dimension , i mean right the way across the curriculum , and i think that 's important . with regard to— . the continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught . we have to recognise— . we have to recognise that , and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in welsh language and in the english language , and they have to be contextualised . we recognise that children learning welsh in a welsh-medium school , their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker , and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning welsh in an english-medium school . vice versa—we 've had this discussion before—if a child is going into welsh medium , their progression in english perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an english-medium school , although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position . so , we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school , but recognising that it is a progression . it is n't a start and never get any further . because , for me , the key factor for making that decision , and i intend to stick to it , is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum— i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . janet finch-saunders am : how will you monitor it ? kirsty williams am : well , as we 've just said , ultimately , we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia , nor are we getting rid of estyn . so , one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that estyn would make to a school . suzy davies am : okay . the other end of the scale now : you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems do n't just clash against each other . how are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there 's a decent dovetail ? lynne neagle am : thank you . and just finally from me , then , on pupil referral units : what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation ? </s>
<s> what did the wiserd research suggest about the distinction in schools ? </s> kirsty williams am : thank you , chair . if i may , i think it 's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been . so , there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement , knowledge and opportunity as possible . so , working through the regional consortia , approximately 120 separate events were organised , and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers , teachers , governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events . we also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves , so that they could give us their feedback . there were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people . we also held some specific events to engage with the business community . we 'll all be familiar , wo n't we , with the narrative of , 'oh , we 're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for ' . so we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process . and obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say . so , members , i 'm sure , will have been aware of the specific pages on hwb that outlined the draft curriculum , and we had 275,000 unique visits to the hwb curriculum pages . it 's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience—which particular aoles were the most popular and were being looked at the most—with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular . so that 's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular aole . what , then , have people said to us ? well , i 'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing . there 's real support for the need for change , because that 's the first question , actually ; why are we doing this , and why do we need to change ? so , support for the need for change , and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum . so , good levels of support for the four purposes , and that driving the content below it . strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession—so , the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities . also , a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment . in terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at , some of that is around some of the language used . can we clarify , can we simplify in some areas , are there things that are repeated in a variety of aoles ? can we use that as an overarching , rather than repeating ourselves ? can we simplify it and clarify some of the language ? also , in some areas— . it 's interesting ; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down , but in other areas , people say , 'well actually , in this bit of it , we need a bit more detail , and a bit more depth and clarity ' . so we 'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we 've had . that process has already started , but considering that this is a massive change , i have been hugely encouraged , actually , by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we 're doing . the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . adding is not necessarily—no , not adding . but , for instance , the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience . so , they 'll be refined , but not added to , and then we will legislate for them , and that had n't been the original intention . sian gwenllian am : okay . will they include mental health and well-being ? kirsty williams am : claire , am i explaining it okay ? sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . hefin david am : okay . and how do you respond , then— ? i mean , it 's a balanced paper , it looks at pros and cons and there 's a mixed picture from it . how do you respond to the specific statement that dr nigel newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils ? kirsty williams am : well , i think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen . these are 'coulds ' and 'maybes ' and things that we need , as a government , to take into consideration as we plan this journey . there ca n't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum is n't being delivered , but i understand , and we need listen to— . if there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into—that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us . i have to say , though , the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity , in the sense that the curriculum is what 's taught in our schools . there is an opportunity , i believe , that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment . what will make the curriculum a success for all of our children , and i believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind , are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum . so , the curriculum on its own can play a part , but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it . and that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation , that has high expectation of all of our children , and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there . secondly : excellent teaching . in the end , no education system , whatever its curriculum , can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in , day out . so , the curriculum can be the most exciting , wonderful—and i think it is exciting and i think it 's wonderful—it can be the most exciting , wonderful thing in the world , but if teachers ca n't teach it effectively , if their pedagogy is not excellent , then the content itself—it wo n't work . then we 've got issues around assessment and accountability . so , how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum ? how do you understand how that pupil , who has , you know—who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons , usually reasons outside of the school— ? that pupil is vulnerable . how can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion ? and then , finally , the well-being of the child . people sometimes say , 'oh , you 're going soft—typical , going soft ' . but what we know is that we can not expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being . but we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child 's well-being . there 's been lots and lots of research done , not in a welsh context but in other systems , where children are kept behind for a year . that has a massive impact on their well-being . so , good achievement leads to good well-being , but good well-being also leads to good achievement , and you ca n't separate the two . so , the curriculum on its own will not be enough . it is the four enabling objectives that sit around it , and we have to be cognisant of the wiserd 's research , of course we do , to ensure that , as we 're doing our professional learning , as we 're planning well-being for our children , as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools—and we have some , we have many , but we need to do more to support them—it is that that will make the biggest difference , not just the content of the curriculum on its own . although i do believe the flexibility that we 're allowing people will , i think , lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they do n't understand why they 're being asked to learn what they 're learning , they do n't see the relevance of what they 're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are , or they do n't see themselves reflected . so , for some of our communities , they do n't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we 're teaching at the moment . and , again , international research would suggest that , if you want a child to thrive , they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they 're learning in schools . hefin david am : what the wiserd research suggests is that the senior management teams—the management teams—would certainly buy into what you 've just said , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' it was the segregation bit i was particularly interested in and the response with regard to disadvantaged pupils and pupils of lower attainment . bridges have been built . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? kirsty williams am : i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . suzy davies am : can i ask , with the assessments , though , which is about pupil progression , will those results be published internally ? will parents get to see those ? kirsty williams am : oh , yes . and that should be the purpose for assessment . the primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child 's educational journey on , and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents , whether they 're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment . so , absolutely , you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods , whichever type they use , with parents , to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child . suzy davies am : and that will be reflected in the school categorisation system as well—will those indicators change , do you think ? okay . well , just finally on that , there may be an argument , then , for scrapping categorisation , putting something else in place . but i suppose the core question is : how are the general public going to understand all those things that you 've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach , the leaders being able to lead , and how well a school is performing against kpis on those measures ? kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . sian gwenllian am : okay . and , in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the welsh language , how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in english-medium schools ? kirsty williams am : okay . just on the welsh dimension , i think it 's really important that whatever resources we have to support the welsh dimension are really , really , really broad and not confined to specific areas . i was in swansea university just this week , looking at some of their technocamp work that they 're doing to help us with coding , and we had an amazing conversation about the welsh contribution to the computing industry . and so my expectation is that that is n't taught in a history lesson—that , actually , when children are learning about coding , they get to hear that welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology . so , that's— . when i talk about a welsh dimension , i mean right the way across the curriculum , and i think that 's important . with regard to— . the continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught . we have to recognise— . we have to recognise that , and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in welsh language and in the english language , and they have to be contextualised . we recognise that children learning welsh in a welsh-medium school , their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker , and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning welsh in an english-medium school . vice versa—we 've had this discussion before—if a child is going into welsh medium , their progression in english perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an english-medium school , although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position . so , we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school , but recognising that it is a progression . it is n't a start and never get any further . sian gwenllian am : with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet , you 've got a question on physical activity . thank you . and just finally from me , then , on pupil referral units : what arrangements will be in place to ensure that they can benefit from the new curriculum and how is that going to be reflected in the legislation ? </s>
<s> what did the meeting talk about the model of scotland ? </s> kirsty williams am : i think what 's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession , we are doing it with our profession . so , in the spirit of co-construction , the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present . so , members will be aware that we 've slightly changed the model . we had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now . pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward , and we 've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools . but above and beyond the innovative schools , we looked at individuals who have specific expertise in subject areas , and they 're the first part of that process . so , they met last week to begin looking at the feedback , and we 'll continue to use the processes that we have to reflect and refine . are there big changes to the concept ? no . opportunities to do things better , explain things better , simplify where possible , where we 've been told that that needs to happen , provide greater depth where we 've been told that needs to happen—absolutely . we 're definitely very alive and very willing to engage in those , but in terms of the overall concept , then no , no significant changes . okay . so , the quality— . we call them—it 's not a very nice name—quality improvement practitioners , the qi practitioners . so , these are the subject specialists . they met last week to begin this process . in october , there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved . by november , we would expect the qi groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process , and that has to be done in both languages . i think it 's really important that we do n't do it in english and then we simply translate it into welsh . so , the editorial process will then be engaged to draw up the final example . it also , then , hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication , our website team will then be working on it , and then we would expect final publication in january—am i right , claire ? the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . hefin david am : can i ask what value you place on the work done by the wales institute of social and economic research , data and methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by dr nigel newton ? so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . okay . so , i think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the scottish curriculum , but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen . so , i think it 's fair to say—and i spent time with some delegates from scotland just this weekend at the atlantic rim collaboratory conference that wales hosted this year . unfortunately , minister swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of brexit preparedness work that he was involved in , but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the ewc in scotland joined us as well as representatives from the scottish government , although not john himself , and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum . part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought— . they spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment . assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in . professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes , i think they would agree that that was n't necessarily— . the middle tier , which they do n't have to the— . well , they 've got local authorities and regions , but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing . so , i think we 've learned— . although our curriculum is n't a copycat , as i said , we have been able to learn from , and we 've had people who have been deeply involved in the scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we 've had in terms of developing coherence . but , steve , i do n't know if— . you speak to your scottish colleagues quite a lot . steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . claire bennett : i think , as we move forward , that kind of cluster approach remains really important . so , it 's , as schools then think about , 'what am i going to do in my school ? ' , that they 're doing that in clusters together . when colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week , they were talking about the very specific and differentiated , i suppose , professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out . their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support , so people are n't just going off in isolation . the other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network . so , there 'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience , bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development , bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed . so , i think that a huge amount of thinking , particularly in the regions , has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools , not just in engaging with the curriculum now , but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools . it feels like—i think graham donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process ' . you do n't start in 2022—people are already doing it and there 's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years . lynne neagle am : very quickly , because i want to move on to implementation . kirsty williams am : i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . dawn bowden am : thank you , chair . yes , just around preparations for the implementation , really . you touched on this briefly in response to some questions from hefin david earlier on , but i 'm just interested to know how the money that you announced for supporting teachers for the preparation of the implementation , how that 's actually been used . what specifically have teachers been doing to prepare for its implementation ? i know you 've set aside about £24 million over two years . so , it 's not an insignificant amount . i just wondered how that was being utilised . kirsty williams am : you 're right , first of all , it 's not an insignificant amount ; it 's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . so , you 're right that it is not insignificant , and it was a hard-won resource , i can tell you , from my colleagues . because , as i said earlier , the curriculum itself can be amazing , but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it , then all this change will be for nothing . so , investing in the profession is absolutely crucial . that money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think , 'what are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school ? ' because , as we 've just heard from claire , there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain . there are other schools that maybe are only beginning now , now that it 's published , to be really engaging with the curriculum . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . dawn bowden am : okay . and the money that you announced for this professional development preparation , if you like , was for two years . so , there 's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development , as well as anything else . but is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you 've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues ? or do you see what you 've put in as being , 'this is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation . the rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that ' ? kirsty williams am : the money that was agreed was for a two-year period and , clearly , i continue to have conversations with the minister for finance and the first minister around future allocations for professional learning , and i 'm sure this committee and , indeed , members of this committee could help me in that task . okay . so , all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase , which is innovation schools , and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within welsh government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us , going forward . i think one of the lessons learned , and this was said in the committee , was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools , but there was a downside to having pioneer schools , and i think , at this stage of the game , we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now—everybody had to be a pioneer—because this is coming down the track and we do n't want anybody just sitting there waiting until september 2022 and saying , 'oh , gosh . i 've got to do something new today ' . not that they would have done that , but— . so , the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we 've all got to engage in this now . the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement , and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues . steve . claire bennett : yes . so , during the first term of work , we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so , take the whole curriculum guidance and then think , 'how would i apply that in the school ? , does it make sense ? , can we work with it ? , what are the issues ? , what are the questions that arise for us for assessment ? ' , and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on , 'if i were putting this into practice— ' . so , it 's slightly different to the feedback we 've had from other people , which has been more , 'maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording ' and kind of quite practical , and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school . that 's been drawn together into an overall report , drawing out the themes , by wavehill , who are a kind of research company . it 's been really useful , and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week . having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable , in just making us think , even with all the practitioners that have been involved , 'how do we make this work for schools ? ' , given that we 've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically . so , it 's been invaluable , and they 're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we 're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically . kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . dawn bowden am : okay . thank you for that clarification . my final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in wales . so , teachers trained in england apply for jobs in wales , but they obviously have n't been trained in the new curriculum . how are we actually going to deal with that ? kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . suzy davies am : i do n't think i 've quite followed that journey . because i get the point of the end point being estyn , and that 's where the public assurance will be seen , but what about the public assurance at those early steps of the teaching standards and the leadership standards ? where will we see those demonstrated ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . oh gosh , that shows that siân thinks that i 'll be here to make that decision . [ laughter . ] that 's very encouraging indeed . [ laughter . ] </s>
<s> how would the money for supporting teachers help in the preparation of the implementation ? </s> sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— lynne neagle am : suzy , you had a supplementary . and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : okay . that gives enough time , then , for it to be— kirsty williams am : and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . suzy davies am : this is n't about assessment . kirsty williams am : you 're right , first of all , it 's not an insignificant amount ; it 's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . so , you 're right that it is not insignificant , and it was a hard-won resource , i can tell you , from my colleagues . because , as i said earlier , the curriculum itself can be amazing , but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it , then all this change will be for nothing . so , investing in the profession is absolutely crucial . that money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think , 'what are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school ? ' because , as we 've just heard from claire , there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain . there are other schools that maybe are only beginning now , now that it 's published , to be really engaging with the curriculum . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . dawn bowden am : okay . and the money that you announced for this professional development preparation , if you like , was for two years . so , there 's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development , as well as anything else . but is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you 've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues ? or do you see what you 've put in as being , 'this is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation . the rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that ' ? kirsty williams am : the money that was agreed was for a two-year period and , clearly , i continue to have conversations with the minister for finance and the first minister around future allocations for professional learning , and i 'm sure this committee and , indeed , members of this committee could help me in that task . lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . lynne neagle am : thank you . dawn . dawn bowden am : okay . thank you for that clarification . my final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in wales . so , teachers trained in england apply for jobs in wales , but they obviously have n't been trained in the new curriculum . how are we actually going to deal with that ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . yes , absolutely . i think some of the trouble that we 've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability , and , when you start using assessment for accountability purposes , that 's when , potentially , that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming . oh , yes . and that should be the purpose for assessment . the primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child 's educational journey on , and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents , whether they 're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment . so , absolutely , you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods , whichever type they use , with parents , to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child . to accountability ? yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . because , for me , the key factor for making that decision , and i intend to stick to it , is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum— sian gwenllian am : so , later on , maybe when this is embedded— kirsty williams am : i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . sian gwenllian am : i get that . that 's why i do n't understand why we 're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the pisa . but , i understand . kirsty williams am : there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . janet finch-saunders am : how will you monitor it ? kirsty williams am : well , as we 've just said , ultimately , we are not getting rid of our school improvement services and regional consortia , nor are we getting rid of estyn . so , one would expect the quality of the curriculum to be a key consideration of any visit that estyn would make to a school . suzy davies am : okay . the other end of the scale now : you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems do n't just clash against each other . how are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there 's a decent dovetail ? okay , that 's great , thank you . </s>
<s> what was the money like in the professional development preparation ? </s> kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . adding is not necessarily—no , not adding . but , for instance , the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience . so , they 'll be refined , but not added to , and then we will legislate for them , and that had n't been the original intention . we 're assuming so . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . hefin david am : yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' bridges have been built . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . suzy davies am : so , on the basis that this is not about assessment , you mentioned that one of the lessons learned from scotland is that they said they spent too much time on curriculum content rather than assessment . can you tell me a little bit about what you 've learned about how they quality control the content , even though the content , of course , will be completely different in wales ? kirsty williams am : yes . i mean , it 's early thoughts , because we 've only just heard about it ourselves . but that 's the beauty of working with other countries . they found that particular useful and successful , and we 're keen to see if we could do something similar . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ?

there 's a thick black line between these two concepts . kirsty williams am : oh , yes . and that should be the purpose for assessment . the primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child 's educational journey on , and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents , whether they 're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment . so , absolutely , you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods , whichever type they use , with parents , to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child . yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . and the schools ' ability—whether they do that well or whether they do n't do it well—will be judged by estyn . we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . sian gwenllian am : with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : because , for me , the key factor for making that decision , and i intend to stick to it , is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum— i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . sian gwenllian am : i get that . that 's why i do n't understand why we 're not actually going for it and showing how good we are through the pisa . but , i understand . kirsty williams am : there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . suzy davies am : okay . the other end of the scale now : you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems do n't just clash against each other . how are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there 's a decent dovetail ? </s>
<s> what did the meeting discuss about the innovation schools ? </s> kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . lynne neagle am : they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . sian gwenllian am : okay , thank you . you 've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year . what is the timetable for the bill itself and for seeking royal assent for that ? okay . that gives enough time , then , for it to be— kirsty williams am : and i think what 's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in january itself , because that 's the bit that schools are really concerned about , and then we will have the process here to underpin it . i always—and welsh government are big supporters of wiserd and the work that they do , and , in fact , we need more research into welsh education , not less . therefore , i find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work . i think what 's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that i hope that , in the time where i 've had an influence to influence over welsh education , either as a backbencher or now as a minister , equality and principles of equity have always driven what i 've tried to achieve . and i would never undertake a policy reform that i thought would lead to less equity in the welsh education system . closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap . hefin david am : so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? kirsty williams am : okay . so , i think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the scottish curriculum , but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen . so , i think it 's fair to say—and i spent time with some delegates from scotland just this weekend at the atlantic rim collaboratory conference that wales hosted this year . unfortunately , minister swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of brexit preparedness work that he was involved in , but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the ewc in scotland joined us as well as representatives from the scottish government , although not john himself , and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum . part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought— . they spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment . assessment has been a crucial part of the process that we have been involved in . professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes , i think they would agree that that was n't necessarily— . the middle tier , which they do n't have to the— . well , they 've got local authorities and regions , but whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing . so , i think we 've learned— . although our curriculum is n't a copycat , as i said , we have been able to learn from , and we 've had people who have been deeply involved in the scottish experience as part of some of our curriculum and assessment groups and some of the advice that we 've had in terms of developing coherence . but , steve , i do n't know if— . you speak to your scottish colleagues quite a lot . the weekend just gone . you 're right , first of all , it 's not an insignificant amount ; it 's the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . so , you 're right that it is not insignificant , and it was a hard-won resource , i can tell you , from my colleagues . because , as i said earlier , the curriculum itself can be amazing , but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it , then all this change will be for nothing . so , investing in the profession is absolutely crucial . that money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think , 'what are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school ? ' because , as we 've just heard from claire , there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain . there are other schools that maybe are only beginning now , now that it 's published , to be really engaging with the curriculum . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . dawn bowden am : okay . and the money that you announced for this professional development preparation , if you like , was for two years . so , there 's going to clearly be an ongoing programme of preparation development and personal development , as well as anything else . but is there likely to be any more money allocated specifically beyond the two years that you 've already allocated or is that going to be a question and negotiation with your colleagues ? or do you see what you 've put in as being , 'this is what we need to develop or to prepare for the implementation . the rest would be what would be normal professional development beyond that ' ? kirsty williams am : the money that was agreed was for a two-year period and , clearly , i continue to have conversations with the minister for finance and the first minister around future allocations for professional learning , and i 'm sure this committee and , indeed , members of this committee could help me in that task . lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . dawn bowden am : i just wanted to clarify , because in your paper you talk about giving £30,000 to each , or to the innovation schools . was that £30,000 each , or £30,000 for the project ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . sian gwenllian am : with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . oh gosh , that shows that siân thinks that i 'll be here to make that decision . [ laughter . ] that 's very encouraging indeed . [ laughter . ] janet finch-saunders am : how will you monitor it ? kirsty williams am : again , janet , i do n't go around monitoring schools now . </s>
<s> how was awareness and understanding of human rights embedded in the new curriculum ? </s> kirsty williams am : thank you , chair . if i may , i think it 's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been . so , there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement , knowledge and opportunity as possible . so , working through the regional consortia , approximately 120 separate events were organised , and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers , teachers , governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events . we also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves , so that they could give us their feedback . there were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people . we also held some specific events to engage with the business community . we 'll all be familiar , wo n't we , with the narrative of , 'oh , we 're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for ' . so we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process . and obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say . so , members , i 'm sure , will have been aware of the specific pages on hwb that outlined the draft curriculum , and we had 275,000 unique visits to the hwb curriculum pages . it 's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience—which particular aoles were the most popular and were being looked at the most—with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular . so that 's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular aole . what , then , have people said to us ? well , i 'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing . there 's real support for the need for change , because that 's the first question , actually ; why are we doing this , and why do we need to change ? so , support for the need for change , and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum . so , good levels of support for the four purposes , and that driving the content below it . strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession—so , the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities . also , a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment . in terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at , some of that is around some of the language used . can we clarify , can we simplify in some areas , are there things that are repeated in a variety of aoles ? can we use that as an overarching , rather than repeating ourselves ? can we simplify it and clarify some of the language ? also , in some areas— . it 's interesting ; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down , but in other areas , people say , 'well actually , in this bit of it , we need a bit more detail , and a bit more depth and clarity ' . so we 'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we 've had . that process has already started , but considering that this is a massive change , i have been hugely encouraged , actually , by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we 're doing . lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , minister . you said that you 're reflecting on the messages that you 've received . are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance ? sian gwenllian am : you 've touched on the point that there 's going to be some sort of change , and you 've mentioned in your paper to us that further specific aspects of the framework of the curriculum are going to be included in the primary legislation . we want to know what those aspects will be and what has made you change your mind . kirsty williams am : the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . adding is not necessarily—no , not adding . but , for instance , the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience . so , they 'll be refined , but not added to , and then we will legislate for them , and that had n't been the original intention . lynne neagle am : they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . kirsty williams am : claire , am i explaining it okay ? claire bennett : yes , the 'what matters ' are the articulation of the big ideas . these are the essence of the core content . so , the idea is to make sure that those are consistent , and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those , which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them . but the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'—it was never what was intended . they were always intended to represent , as a whole , the learning that every learner should get . they wo n't be literally in the bill , because , obviously , you might want to change the emphasis , so that 'll be provided for in subordinate legislation , but the provision will be there , and they will have the status of something that 's not optional , basically , for a school . sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— suzy davies am : just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation . the point you 've made is one that government has made with other legislation prior to this , but can i just ask you to consider the worthiness , if you like , or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters ' statements , the first round of those , in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course ? the reason i ask this is just to explain to the population of wales that there is certainty at the first step , bearing in mind that it will change over the years—i completely accept that . but when you 're amending primary legislation , you do n't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that . so , i 'm just asking you to consider that . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : moving on , therefore , to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education , i understand that you 've had numerous responses to the white paper surrounding this particular area . what are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what 's been said ? okay . and your response ? kirsty williams am : and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . hefin david am : what the wiserd research suggests is that the senior management teams—the management teams—would certainly buy into what you 've just said , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' bridges have been built . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . suzy davies am : okay , that 's interesting . okay , thank you . kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . thank you . dawn . dawn bowden am : okay . thank you for that clarification . my final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in wales . so , teachers trained in england apply for jobs in wales , but they obviously have n't been trained in the new curriculum . how are we actually going to deal with that ? kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . oh , yes . and that should be the purpose for assessment . the primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child 's educational journey on , and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents , whether they 're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment . so , absolutely , you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods , whichever type they use , with parents , to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child . suzy davies am : okay . well , just finally on that , there may be an argument , then , for scrapping categorisation , putting something else in place . but i suppose the core question is : how are the general public going to understand all those things that you 've just mentioned about the teachers being able to teach , the leaders being able to lead , and how well a school is performing against kpis on those measures ? okay . so , it 's all going to go in through the estyn reports . this is the kind of detail i 'm after . kirsty williams am : yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . okay . just on the welsh dimension , i think it 's really important that whatever resources we have to support the welsh dimension are really , really , really broad and not confined to specific areas . i was in swansea university just this week , looking at some of their technocamp work that they 're doing to help us with coding , and we had an amazing conversation about the welsh contribution to the computing industry . and so my expectation is that that is n't taught in a history lesson—that , actually , when children are learning about coding , they get to hear that welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology . so , that's— . when i talk about a welsh dimension , i mean right the way across the curriculum , and i think that 's important . with regard to— . the continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught . we have to recognise— . we have to recognise that , and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in welsh language and in the english language , and they have to be contextualised . we recognise that children learning welsh in a welsh-medium school , their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker , and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning welsh in an english-medium school . vice versa—we 've had this discussion before—if a child is going into welsh medium , their progression in english perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an english-medium school , although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position . so , we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school , but recognising that it is a progression . it is n't a start and never get any further . because , for me , the key factor for making that decision , and i intend to stick to it , is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum— lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet , you 've got a question on physical activity . </s>
<s> what should be included in the implementation of the welsh dimension ? </s> lynne neagle am : okay . thank you , minister . you said that you 're reflecting on the messages that you 've received . are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance ? they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . kirsty williams am : claire , am i explaining it okay ? lynne neagle am : suzy , you had a supplementary . kirsty williams am : we 're assuming so . lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . sian gwenllian am : okay . and your response ? okay , thank you . you 've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year . what is the timetable for the bill itself and for seeking royal assent for that ? hefin david am : yes : 'different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' bridges have been built . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . hefin david am : and the final question : there is a process , a model for this , which is scotland . what kind of lessons are being learned from the introduction of their curriculum ? kirsty williams am : where ? hefin david am : right . lynne neagle am : very quickly , because i want to move on to implementation . okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . sian gwenllian am : are you confident that every school across wales is participating in this process of change now , because the danger is , in getting these pioneer schools— ? i understand that they are discussing in clusters , and so on , but can you put your hand on your heart and say that every school is participating in this project now ? lynne neagle am : thank you . dawn . dawn bowden am : okay . thank you for that clarification . my final question in this section is just about how we are going to deal with the issue of teachers who are not trained in wales . so , teachers trained in england apply for jobs in wales , but they obviously have n't been trained in the new curriculum . how are we actually going to deal with that ? kirsty williams am : to accountability ? yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet . sian gwenllian am : turning to the welsh dimension in the new curriculum , the learned society of wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that welsh dimension . do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource ? kirsty williams am : we have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum . it 's one of the conversations i had with qualifications wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we 've had previously , where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications are n't available . so , we 're already having those conversations with qualifications wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum . and this proposal by the learned society will be considered as part of that work . sian gwenllian am : with regard to the creative thinking element of pisa , i take it that you are adhering to the fact that the welsh government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to pisa 2020. i do n't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking . so , why not participate in these tests ? kirsty williams am : because , for me , the key factor for making that decision , and i intend to stick to it , is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum— i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . sian gwenllian am : so , you 'll think about it for the next round of pisa . steve davies : one very quick technical point , chair . we have not opted out of this . countries were offered if they wished to take the invite to come into it , and a number of countries across the world are yet to make their decision on this . lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet , you 've got a question on physical activity . janet finch-saunders am : how will you monitor it ? kirsty williams am : well , of course . as we 've just said— </s>
<s> what did the meeting talk about the single continuum of learning with regard to the welsh language ? </s> kirsty williams am : thank you , chair . if i may , i think it 's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been . so , there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as much engagement , knowledge and opportunity as possible . so , working through the regional consortia , approximately 120 separate events were organised , and we believe that in the region of 6,000 headteachers , teachers , governors and teaching assistants have actually had an opportunity to participate in those events . we also held a number of focus group sessions specifically for young people themselves , so that they could give us their feedback . there were 24 focus groups that were arranged for children and young people . we also held some specific events to engage with the business community . we 'll all be familiar , wo n't we , with the narrative of , 'oh , we 're sending people out into the world of business without the skills that we as an employer are looking for ' . so we thought it was really important to engage business so that they can have their say and their input into the process . and obviously we work very hard on making it as easy as possible via new technology for people to have their say . so , members , i 'm sure , will have been aware of the specific pages on hwb that outlined the draft curriculum , and we had 275,000 unique visits to the hwb curriculum pages . it 's really interesting to see the breakdown of the areas of learning and experience—which particular aoles were the most popular and were being looked at the most—with our creative and performing arts and the creativity and the expressive arts being the most popular . so that 's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular aole . what , then , have people said to us ? well , i 'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing . there 's real support for the need for change , because that 's the first question , actually ; why are we doing this , and why do we need to change ? so , support for the need for change , and lots of support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum . so , good levels of support for the four purposes , and that driving the content below it . strong support for greater autonomy and agency for the profession—so , the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities . also , a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment . in terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at , some of that is around some of the language used . can we clarify , can we simplify in some areas , are there things that are repeated in a variety of aoles ? can we use that as an overarching , rather than repeating ourselves ? can we simplify it and clarify some of the language ? also , in some areas— . it 's interesting ; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down , but in other areas , people say , 'well actually , in this bit of it , we need a bit more detail , and a bit more depth and clarity ' . so we 'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we 've had . that process has already started , but considering that this is a massive change , i have been hugely encouraged , actually , by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we 're doing . the original proposal that we began working on was , in the legislation , to provide for the four purposes—so , the four purposes would be set out in the legislation—as well as putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with . then , below that , we were going to legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects—so , the literacy , the numeracy and the digital competency—as well as some elements where we had already said that we were going to make that statutory , so , for instance , above and beyond what graham donaldson would have put in his original reports . a good example of that is relationships and sexuality education . i 've already made an announcement that i was going to put rse on the face of the bill . so , the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody— . so , we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . so , we 're bringing it a step lower again . rather than simply , in law , leaving it at the aole level , we 'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters ' statements within that , again , providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level . we 'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the aole areas . so , there has been in the chamber—i can see suzy is writing this down—suzy has asked me questions about , 'how do you create a national expectation around progression ? ' we 've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process , so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out . as i said , we are proposing those changes because of responses that we 've had . one of the consistent worries that some people have had , whilst being very supportive of the overall aims , is how do you get that balance between individual autonomy in the school , but also ensure that there is some national expectation and that the variation on these important things is not so great as to cause concern . so , we 've reflected on that . i set up a process—this was an open process , and we were open to listening to people . so , i think those will be the two main areas where we had n't originally thought that we would legislate for , but that we will now legislate for . adding is not necessarily—no , not adding . but , for instance , the children have given us some interesting feedback about what they feel really matters in those areas of learning and experience . so , they 'll be refined , but not added to , and then we will legislate for them , and that had n't been the original intention . lynne neagle am : they are in the annex to the paper , siân , and , obviously , mental health is in there . so , just to clarify , then , that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law . claire bennett : yes , the 'what matters ' are the articulation of the big ideas . these are the essence of the core content . so , the idea is to make sure that those are consistent , and then that still leaves huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those , which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them . but the concept that you might not do one 'what matters'—it was never what was intended . they were always intended to represent , as a whole , the learning that every learner should get . they wo n't be literally in the bill , because , obviously , you might want to change the emphasis , so that 'll be provided for in subordinate legislation , but the provision will be there , and they will have the status of something that 's not optional , basically , for a school . sian gwenllian am : therefore , it 's not going to be on the face of the bill—the mental health aspect , for example . and there are other matters that we 've raised here . this is what i 'm not clear about . you 're saying that it 's subordinate , but then you 're saying— lynne neagle am : and we 'll have an opportunity to influence it . siân . kirsty williams am : well , these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded . it 's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths , english , welsh , science , but there we go ; i guess it 's the nature of the areas that we 're talking about . with regard to religious education , we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards re that were set out in the white paper . i think amongst the things that people have objected to were— . there were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and world religions included in that area of learning . many people said that there needed to be a much clearer and stronger—and in some cases exclusive—focus on christianity , as opposed to including other world religions and , indeed , non-religious views . so , secular views or spiritual—spirituality rather than organised religion . there were people who thought that re should n't be compulsory at all and therefore our proposals to ensure that re was compulsory , people objected to that , on the other— . and there were many responses that were concerned about and emphasised the need to respect parents ' views . so , if a child 's parents have certain views , those are to be respected . of those respondents that agreed that re should be a compulsory part of the curriculum , or were neutral—did n't express an opinion either way , but were neutral on the question—the issues that they were bringing forward were : a need for learners , as they saw it , to be prepared to be part of a diverse and multicultural society . so , they wanted re to be much more broad-based and encompassing of world views and world religions . they felt that that was an important part of preparing a young person to live in a world that is , as you say , diverse with people of different views living in it . there is certainly a need to modernise re ; some people perceived the current curriculum as a bit old-fashioned . and also there was much feedback on making sure that the profession was ready to deliver a renewed , modernised re curriculum . so , those are the issues around religious education— yes . claire , would you say that it was a co-ordinated response ? and my response : well , clearly , siân , i need to consider those responses , and both for re and rse , i shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues . with regard to rse , the key messages , again , are focused on whether children should be taught rse at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it should n't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved , and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education . there were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum . so , those were the main areas that people were concerned about . with regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum , there were strong views that , again , it should be parents , and parents alone , that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules . so , i have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise . i think these are really important aspects of our curriculum . i think if we are to achieve the four purposes , and that 's how we have always got to think about it , and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes ? how are they healthy , confident individuals ? how are we to prepare our children to be ethical , informed citizens of wales and the world ? so , we will reflect on what has come back to us , but i do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum , if we are to achieve the four purposes . i always—and welsh government are big supporters of wiserd and the work that they do , and , in fact , we need more research into welsh education , not less . therefore , i find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work . i think what 's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that i hope that , in the time where i 've had an influence to influence over welsh education , either as a backbencher or now as a minister , equality and principles of equity have always driven what i 've tried to achieve . and i would never undertake a policy reform that i thought would lead to less equity in the welsh education system . closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap . hefin david am : okay . and how do you respond , then— ? i mean , it 's a balanced paper , it looks at pros and cons and there 's a mixed picture from it . how do you respond to the specific statement that dr nigel newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils ? kirsty williams am : well , i think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen . these are 'coulds ' and 'maybes ' and things that we need , as a government , to take into consideration as we plan this journey . there ca n't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum is n't being delivered , but i understand , and we need listen to— . if there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into—that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us . i have to say , though , the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity , in the sense that the curriculum is what 's taught in our schools . there is an opportunity , i believe , that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment . what will make the curriculum a success for all of our children , and i believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind , are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum . so , the curriculum on its own can play a part , but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it . and that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation , that has high expectation of all of our children , and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there . secondly : excellent teaching . in the end , no education system , whatever its curriculum , can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in , day out . so , the curriculum can be the most exciting , wonderful—and i think it is exciting and i think it 's wonderful—it can be the most exciting , wonderful thing in the world , but if teachers ca n't teach it effectively , if their pedagogy is not excellent , then the content itself—it wo n't work . then we 've got issues around assessment and accountability . so , how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum ? how do you understand how that pupil , who has , you know—who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons , usually reasons outside of the school— ? that pupil is vulnerable . how can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion ? and then , finally , the well-being of the child . people sometimes say , 'oh , you 're going soft—typical , going soft ' . but what we know is that we can not expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being . but we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child 's well-being . there 's been lots and lots of research done , not in a welsh context but in other systems , where children are kept behind for a year . that has a massive impact on their well-being . so , good achievement leads to good well-being , but good well-being also leads to good achievement , and you ca n't separate the two . so , the curriculum on its own will not be enough . it is the four enabling objectives that sit around it , and we have to be cognisant of the wiserd 's research , of course we do , to ensure that , as we 're doing our professional learning , as we 're planning well-being for our children , as we think about assessment methods and how we develop a culture of strong leaders in our schools—and we have some , we have many , but we need to do more to support them—it is that that will make the biggest difference , not just the content of the curriculum on its own . although i do believe the flexibility that we 're allowing people will , i think , lead to a curriculum and more meaningful lessons for some children in schools who are in danger of disengaging because they do n't understand why they 're being asked to learn what they 're learning , they do n't see the relevance of what they 're learning to what they may want to do or how their lives are , or they do n't see themselves reflected . so , for some of our communities , they do n't see themselves reflected in the curriculum that we 're teaching at the moment . and , again , international research would suggest that , if you want a child to thrive , they have to see themselves and their community reflected in what they 're learning in schools . hefin david am : what the wiserd research suggests is that the senior management teams—the management teams—would certainly buy into what you 've just said , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . so , if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by wiserd at the seminar two comments jump out : 'we 'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'we 'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum . ' and 'there will be no consistency ' . and consistency is the one i 'd particularly like to focus on : 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes ' . kirsty williams am : bridges have been— . well , from my perspective , the bridges were always there . but we 've got renewed , energetic engagement from the wlga and adew in all the arrangements that we have for the development of the curriculum and my understanding is that they have said publicly and in writing that they 're very supportive of what 's going on . steve davies : as i said , they 're very forthright in sharing their learning and i think one of the critical elements was the extent to which assessment was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content . so , that was critical , but we 've embraced experts who were involved in that process who were part of our curriculum assessment group . so , they feed in throughout—not 'do n't do this because scotland has done it ' , but they feed some of that learning into the system . as the minister said , we had seven other countries from across the world giving us feedback and input over four days as to where we can continue to look at what we 're doing but also checks and balances against some of their experiences with this area of reform . claire bennett : i think , as we move forward , that kind of cluster approach remains really important . so , it 's , as schools then think about , 'what am i going to do in my school ? ' , that they 're doing that in clusters together . when colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week , they were talking about the very specific and differentiated , i suppose , professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out . their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support , so people are n't just going off in isolation . the other thing that will also help in that process will be the national network . so , there 'll continue to be a focus for each area of learning and experience , bringing together the professional learning and the ongoing curriculum development , bringing together practitioners and experts and colleagues across the middle tier to give a bit of strategic direction and to be able to identify if there are areas where more support is needed . so , i think that a huge amount of thinking , particularly in the regions , has gone on into the practical support that can be given to schools , not just in engaging with the curriculum now , but then how they take it and think about then developing it in their schools . it feels like—i think graham donaldson was calling it a 'slow-burn process ' . you do n't start in 2022—people are already doing it and there 's a lot of thought going into how to support continued sharing through the next two years . kirsty williams am : i do n't know if they— . i do n't know if they did , but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that , certainly some of the canadian systems , in particular , which we were interested in , used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so , actually taking the time to ask students how they felt , not just about the content of the new curriculum , but actually how they felt their school was doing . and so we 're interested in looking , as i said , at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what 's happening . there is a national element to it , but we 've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because i have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how much additional support they 're going to need . there 's no way i can know that . the people who do know that are the headteachers that are running our schools . but we have worked with the national academy for educational leadership to put together a programme for headteachers , and that 's national . the four regional consortia are working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . so , actually , the beginning of their discussion is about how you would implement a curriculum . the next stages will be much more focused on individual aole and area-specific professional learning . so , there is a national approach in terms of leadership . the regional consortia are working together to provide consistency for classroom teachers and teaching assistants , and then the next stage of that development is for subject specifics . claire referred to the aole networks , and there 's an opportunity then for people to engage in that . it 's also important to say that that 's not the end of the process . so , this september is the start of our new ite courses , taught for the first time , and that 's great . i 'm concerned about what happens to people when they come out of ite . so , we 're looking at developing potentially a stronger set of support , again on a national basis , for those who are newly qualified , beginning their teaching career , because i do n't think we 've done that on a consistently good level across the country . we 're also working with the regions to revisit and improve their coaching and mentoring schemes that they have across the system . we 're also involved in—and i 'm sure the committee has heard about it , so forgive me if i 'm going over old ground—schools as learning organisations and the oecd work to support schools to develop that culture as a learning organisation . we know from very successful education systems in other parts of the world there is a strong , strong culture of self-evaluation as a first step in their school improvement system , and we 've not been very good at that in wales , we 've not been strong at that , that 's not the culture that we have had . we 've kind of depended on a culture where a school does its thing and then somebody comes along and tells you whether you 're good or bad , rather than the school really thinking itself deeply about , 'what are we doing well and what do we need to improve on ? ' so , the schools as learning organisations are an important part , again , so that money is being used for schools participating in that programme with support from the oecd . okay . so , all of our schools that had previously been pioneers were invited to apply to morph into the next phase , which is innovation schools , and they were asked to apply and there was a discussion held both internally within welsh government and with the consortia about which schools were best placed to be able to do that role and to continue to work with us , going forward . i think one of the lessons learned , and this was said in the committee , was that there was an upside to having pioneer schools , but there was a downside to having pioneer schools , and i think , at this stage of the game , we need to move away from that model and to really get the message to everybody that they all had to be pioneers now—everybody had to be a pioneer—because this is coming down the track and we do n't want anybody just sitting there waiting until september 2022 and saying , 'oh , gosh . i 've got to do something new today ' . not that they would have done that , but— . so , the move away is partly to engender within the sector the fact that we 've all got to engage in this now . the innovation schools have led to a very specific piece of work as we do the final refinement , and their main role is working with us on these final refinements to the content but also to the assessment issues and accountability issues . steve . claire bennett : yes . so , during the first term of work , we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so , take the whole curriculum guidance and then think , 'how would i apply that in the school ? , does it make sense ? , can we work with it ? , what are the issues ? , what are the questions that arise for us for assessment ? ' , and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on , 'if i were putting this into practice— ' . so , it 's slightly different to the feedback we 've had from other people , which has been more , 'maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording ' and kind of quite practical , and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school . that 's been drawn together into an overall report , drawing out the themes , by wavehill , who are a kind of research company . it 's been really useful , and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week . having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable , in just making us think , even with all the practitioners that have been involved , 'how do we make this work for schools ? ' , given that we 've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically . so , it 's been invaluable , and they 're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we 're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically . kirsty williams am : if you think of the pioneer model , pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum . so , you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being , or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum . this is about , at this stage , where we have a high degree of certainty about what it 's going to look like , 'actually , how do i as a school practically implement this in the round ? ' , and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that . but also we did need a mix of sector—secondary , primary—but also linguistically , to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we 've got . faith schools , as well , are involved . so , just trying the practical implementation now , now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it 's actually going to look like , so , 'how am i going to go about doing this ? ' lynne neagle am : okay . siân has a supplementary . if i could ask as well , maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools . steve davies : i ca n't tell you that , absolutely , 100 per cent are definitely , totally , absolutely equally involved . the structure we 've got in place across the regions is working with schools on their readiness to actually—not readiness to engage—start to deliver as we move through to the future . so , each region is a member of our operations board , which was in our governance structure . and we do n't have a roll-call against all schools , but we require them , or request of them that they keep us informed of the networks . every school is part of a network that links to it , and they gauge ( 1 ) the level of activity in it , ( 2 ) the outcomes of that work , because each of the networks , each of the clusters , produces work that the region brings together . but we 've not got a monitoring system that says , 'tick every box ' . what i would say , and it touches on the point you raised earlier and in relation to scotland , i think if we had 22 units of local authorities trying to do this , it would be incredibly complex and very difficult to deliver . at a regional level , we require the regions to engage with all schools through the cluster model . kirsty williams am : okay . well , you 're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in wales will teach in england and teachers trained in england or who have worked in england will come across the border , as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools . i think that that will continue to happen . indeed , when i 'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues , i think wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals , as well as an exciting new curriculum . so , i think , actually , potentially , we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it 'll be a great place to be a professional . clearly , already in some ways , programmes of study are already distinctive in wales . we have a different exam board , if you 're teaching at a secondary level . so , our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system . i believe that that 's not a barrier to people continuing to do that . clearly , there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with , but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system , because we 've just talked about the two years ' worth of money ; in an ideal world , if i was able to make long-term plans , i think there will be an ongoing , and there should always be an ongoing , provision for professional learning in our classrooms . and this should n't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets . one of the ways in which i think we can attract teachers to wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession , wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning . so , i do not see that this is an insurmountable issue . yes , that 's the ultimate , is n't it ? so , the ultimate is— . the ultimate system that we 're going to get to and the ultimate arbiter and the part of the system that provides public assurance and public confidence ultimately ends in estyn . but it starts with our teaching standards and the professionalism of individual members of staff . that 's where it starts , and it ends in estyn . okay . just on the welsh dimension , i think it 's really important that whatever resources we have to support the welsh dimension are really , really , really broad and not confined to specific areas . i was in swansea university just this week , looking at some of their technocamp work that they 're doing to help us with coding , and we had an amazing conversation about the welsh contribution to the computing industry . and so my expectation is that that is n't taught in a history lesson—that , actually , when children are learning about coding , they get to hear that welsh people have been at the forefront of developing this technology . so , that's— . when i talk about a welsh dimension , i mean right the way across the curriculum , and i think that 's important . with regard to— . the continuum for language will have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child is being taught . we have to recognise— . we have to recognise that , and there will be progression points on that continuum that will be there to show progression both in welsh language and in the english language , and they have to be contextualised . we recognise that children learning welsh in a welsh-medium school , their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker , and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning welsh in an english-medium school . vice versa—we 've had this discussion before—if a child is going into welsh medium , their progression in english perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an english-medium school , although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position . so , we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school , but recognising that it is a progression . it is n't a start and never get any further . i think there could well be a different decision at a later date , but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it . can i just say ? in terms of creativity , wales is seen as an exemplar by the oecd , especially our partnership with the arts council of wales and creative learning through the arts . there could well be a different decision , but for 2021 we 're asking enough of people at the moment and this would be an unnecessary addition to cope with . i just do n't think that that should be seen as us running away from it because we 're worried about a lack of creativity in our education system . the very opposite is true . we are seen as exemplars by the oecd and some of the work that 's been going on with creative learning through the schools is now being shared internationally . oh gosh , that shows that siân thinks that i 'll be here to make that decision . [ laughter . ] that 's very encouraging indeed . [ laughter . ] lynne neagle am : okay , thank you . janet , you 've got a question on physical activity . </s>
<s> summarize the meeting </s> professor b : test . hmm . let 's see . move it bit . test ? test ? ok , i guess it 's alright . so , let 's see . yeah , barry 's not here and dave 's not here . um , i can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that dave and i submitted this asru . phd a : you mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ? phd d : s sixty - four . no , the edge . so the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred professor b : oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the fft ? phd d : um , yeah , we we 've tried including the full full bank . right ? from zero to four k . yeah , i mean , make it a hundred or so ? professor b : on what test set ? and on and on the , um , um , ti - digits also ? would that be more like well , you 'd think that 'd be more like speechdat - car , i guess , in terms of the noise . the speechdat - car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . and and ti - digits maybe is not so much as yeah , that 's on the far field . yeah , the near field 's pretty good . phd a : i see . professor b : week and a half . so they do it right at the beginning of the semester . so . that 's sort of what we found . phd a : and he gave me all of the pointers and everything that i needed . and so i downloaded the , um there were two things , uh , that they had to download . one was the , uh , i guess the software . and another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that . and it compiled fine . and , um , i grabbed the sample stuff but i have n't , uh , compiled it . phd d : oh , there is another short sample set o o sample . phd a : and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . professor b : yeah . yeah , it 's like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for us . phd d : cuz they have , uh , already frozen those in i insertion penalties and all those stuff is what i feel . because they have this document explaining the recognizer . and , uh , on that , i mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those phd a : and so they 've picked the values . phd d : yeah , i think they pi p uh , p the one that they have reported is a nist evaluation , wall street journal . professor b : but that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ? phd d : you know . no . so they 're , like um so they are actually trying to , uh , fix that those values using the clean , uh , training part of the wall street journal . which is i mean , the aurora . aurora has a clean subset . i mean , they want to train it and then this they 're going to run some evaluations . professor b : ok . so now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we ca n't modify these parameters . uh but it 's still worth , i think , just since you know , just chatting with joe about the issue . well , it 's not a secret . i mean , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but i think i think that , um um , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to uh @ @ { comment } you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , but , uh , i noticed , just glancing at the , uh , hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing i do n't know well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . oh . uh , he he , uh he was here for a couple years and he , uh got his phd . he and he 's , uh , been at ibm for the last couple years . phd c : before it was just p l phd d : yeah , it was actually no . not i mean , it was just the noisy features i guess . professor b : s so , i 'm i 'm sorry , there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ? twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . phd c : hidden and phd a : so , i 'm i 'm s so what is different between this and and what you professor b : that 's great . two - seventy . one hundred milliseconds for smoothing . phd c : um so it 's @ @ professor b : forty p phd d : so it 's two hundred actually . phd c : yeah , there are twenty that comes from there is ten that comes from the lda filters also . right ? plus the frame , yeah , i think it 's it 's five frames , but . professor b : uh , p wait a minute . it 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech , phd c : so . forty cleaning . professor b : forty for the i n ann , a hundred for the smoothing . phd c : twenty for the delta . professor b : twenty for delta . phd d : at th at the input . i mean , that 's at the input to the net . professor b : ten milliseconds for lda filter , and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? phd c : for the frame i guess . i computed two - twenty yeah , well , it 's i guess it 's for the fr the no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . professor b : um , so the delta at the end is how much ? phd a : could that help a little bit ? i mean , i guess there 's a lot of things you could do to professor b : and then y then you do n't have that additive phd a : is two hundred the d professor b : well , we do n't know . they 're still arguing about it . uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . professor b : right . well , so you say let 's say ten milliseconds seconds for the lda . phd c : and and but the lda is , well , pretty short right now . phd d : yeah , the lda lda we do n't know , is , like is it very crucial for the features , right ? phd c : no . i just this is the first try . professor b : i mean , you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice , right ? but yo w were you doing that before ? phd d : on the in the mm - hmm . just yeah , just the static , no delta . professor b : right ? so i think , you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing , right ? phd c : it would professor b : yeah . yeah . and we still do n't have the neural net in . so so it 's i mean , we 're getting better recognition . i mean , i 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , but phd d : o o or the best we can get . phd a : i see . professor b : and , uh and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating vad . and fifty - seven is what you got with the real vad . that 's great . phd c : uh , yeah , the next thing is , i started to play well , i do n't want to worry too much about the delay , no . maybe it 's better to wait from the committee . uh , but i started to play with the , um , uh , tandem neural network . mmm i just did the configuration that 's very similar to what we did for the february proposal . and um . so . there is a f a first feature stream that use uh straight mfcc features . well , these features actually . and the other stream is the output of a neural network , using as input , also , these , um , cleaned mfcc . um phd a : those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net ? phd c : so there is just this feature stream , { comment } the fifteen mfcc plus delta and double - delta . um , so it 's makes forty - five features { comment } that are used as input to the htk . and then , there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem mlp . professor b : y you have ninety features ? there is n't any klt or anything ? phd a : that 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? phd c : i do n't know . phd a : i see . phd c : but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the phd d : so , was the training set same as the p the february proposal ? ok . professor b : i the other thing is , i mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different , right ? so , um , uh , for instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd c : yeah . i g i guess . um . the reason i did it this ways is that in february , it we we tested different things like that , so , having two klt , having just a klt for a network , or having a global klt . phd a : so you tried the global klt before i see . professor b : and i guess if the these are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into , um , the , uh the hmm . phd c : so , yeah , maybe we can add some context from these features also as dan did in in his last work . professor b : could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd c : the f the forty - eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features . professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd d : what are the s n rs in the training set , timit ? professor b : yeah . so we found this this , uh this macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . we ca n't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount , phd d : right ? so you i so it had like all these different conditions of s n rs , actually in their training set of neural net . for the training of the neural net . yeah , so now the after - noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of s n rs than that was originally there in the training set . of timit . because in the timit it was zero to some clean . so the net saw all the snr @ @ conditions . and that snr may not be , like , com covering the whole set of s n rs that you 're getting in the speechdat - car . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , it is . but , i 'm saying , there could be some some issues of on the test set , yeah . phd c : yeah , we 'll so we 'll see . uh . professor b : i mean , one of the things about phd c : they p stayed the same , clean training and the feature are the same except that `` train station `` , yeah . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : so i wonder what the net effect is . yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd a : you know , i 've been wondering about something . in the , um a lot of the , um the hub - five systems , um , recently have been using lda . and and they , um they run lda on the features right before they train the models . so there 's the the lda is is right there before the h m so , you guys are using lda but it seems like it 's pretty far back in the process . phd d : uh , this lda is different from the lda that you are talking about . the lda that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , { comment } and then do an lda on it , phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? yeah . right , it 's the it 's right . the so yeah , so it 's sort of like but i mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , phd c : yeah , it might be that lda could be better . phd a : yeah . exactly . i mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the hub - five system , and , um , andreas and i talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , `` well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the lda in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . we just want to show . i mean , it everybody believes it , but you know , we just professor b : i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd c : it 's the transformation they 're estimating on well , they are trained on the same data as the final hmm are . phd a : so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , professor b : so it still has most of the delay , well , w i phd d : at the input of the neural net you have this , uh , f nine frames of context plus the delta . professor b : oh , plus the delta , phd d : yeah . so that delay , plus the lda . professor b : what about using it in the neural net ? phd d : yeah , so yeah , so that 's the yeah . so we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . professor b : and then but , yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet . so we have to figure out the neural nets , i guess . phd d : the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , we have the vad information also available at the back - end . phd a : i see . so you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . phd d : to yeah . so it it 's an additional discriminating information . professor b : you could feed it into the neural net . the other thing { comment } you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , { comment } based on the fact that you have a silence probability . well , u not sure . i mean , let 's put it this way . i mean , y you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters phd a : right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? but i mean i mean , train the net only on professor b : well , yeah . but this other thing is n't perfect . so that you bring in some information from the net itself . phd c : yeah . yeah , like the entropy of the the output , phd a : but if you were gon na put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? professor b : yeah . well , we just started working with it . but these are these are some good ideas i think . phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? phd c : mm - hmm . oh , it would be yeah . around five percent better , i guess . if if i professor b : well , we do n't know what 's it 's gon na be the ti - digits yet . he has n't got the results back yet . phd c : i d i d i just have the speechdat - car right now , so phd a : when when do you leave ? professor b : uh , i 'm leaving next wednesday . may or may not be in in the morning . i leave in the afternoon . um , and uh , that 's during eurospeech . phd a : so that 's you wo n't be at the next three of these meetings . is that right ? professor b : um mmm . { comment } so it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , phd a : when do you go back ? professor b : yeah . yeah . so . cool . phd c : i do n't know . the meeting in is the five and six of december . so </s>
<s> summarize the discussion on deletions and improving the net </s> phd d : yeah , if you 're using the baseline . professor b : for some reason , uh , dave thought it was twenty , phd d : so it was professor b : and on and on the , um , um , ti - digits also ? phd a : i see . there was another short one , yeah . and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . phd d : ok . oh , ok . f yeah , ok . phd a : no , i i d you asked me to write to him and i think i forgot to ask him about that . or if i did ask him , he did n't reply . phd d : cuz they have it phd a : uh - huh . phd d : yeah , i think they pi p phd a : oh , ok . phd d : yeah . phd a : yeah . professor b : but , um , phd d : yeah . phd a : yeah , ok . do you think that 's something i should just send to him or do you think i should send it to this there 's an a m a mailing list . professor b : uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . but if if , uh if there is n't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . phd d : because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . phd a : yeah , susi or whatever it was phd d : ok , that 's fine . phd a : oh , ok . oh , ok . professor b : what was it using before ? phd c : before it was just p l phd d : yeah , it was actually no . not i mean , it was just the noisy features i guess . phd a : ah . ok . professor b : that 's great . phd c : if yeah , if you add the c delta comp delta computation which is done afterwards . um the two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um no , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . um then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . so it adds forty milliseconds . um so it 's @ @ professor b : and then forty forty p phd d : oh , ok . if you are using phd c : so . forty cleaning . phd d : and there i professor b : oh , it does ? ah . so in that case there is n't too much in parallel . uh phd d : it 's phd a : what if you used a smaller window for the delta ? could that help a little bit ? i mean , i guess there 's a lot of things you could do to professor b : uh then then it could go in parallel . and then y then you do n't have that additive phd c : so . it should not make phd a : so , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b : uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . phd a : uh - huh . oh , ok , i see . ah , ok . professor b : he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . yeah . no . i just this is the first try . phd d : yeah . professor b : right ? so i think , phd c : it would phd d : o o or the best we can get . phd c : mmm yeah . then you wou you would go phd a : so that 's sort of the best you could hope for . i see . phd c : yeah . professor b : that 's great . phd c : for the decision phd a : oh , oh . ok . i see . uh - huh . professor b : and you 're just feeding them like that . phd c : and yeah . so um . phd a : i see . phd c : but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . professor b : well , yeah . phd c : but it 's worse . yeah , i phd a : oh , i see . phd c : well phd a : i see . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : are not . could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . oh , i know what i was gon na say . so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah , i see . professor b : maybe . you know . yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : yeah . phd c : yeah . yeah . professor b : much more than that , it was n't much better . hmm . phd c : yeah . @ @ ? phd d : right ? so you i phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : so the net saw all the snr @ @ conditions . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , it is . but , i 'm saying , there could be some some issues of hmm . mm - hmm . phd c : yeah . so yeah , we 'll so we 'll see . uh . phd d : yeah . phd c : maybe . phd d : then it 's something to do . phd c : they p stayed the same , they are a little bit better . yeah . but the feature are the same except that yeah . it was b a little bit worse . professor b : well , that 's interesting . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . phd d : yeah , so it 's four . is i so either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . professor b : yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd d : yeah . phd a : you know , i 've been wondering about something . yeah , you c you c you can . ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? phd d : uh , it phd c : yeah . it 's yeah . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah . phd a : but i mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , phd c : uh . mm - hmm . yeah , i know . that that yeah . well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using pca , but phd a : uh - huh . phd c : yeah , it might be that lda could be better . phd a : yeah . so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . though , maybe not . well , i think that 's a good idea . did did you do that phd a : we just want to show . but you know , we just i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , but um . professor b : but i d i 'm sorry , oh , plus the delta , mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : because they did that itself phd c : then you do n't have to worry about the thresholds and professor b : uh - huh . phd d : from the f f while testing . we have the vad information also available at the back - end . phd c : uh , still not . yeah . phd d : yeah . so phd a : oh , oh , i see . i see . ok . ok . phd d : so that professor b : you could feed it into the neural net . the other thing { comment } you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , { comment } based on the fact that you have a silence probability . phd c : yeah . phd d : through t to the soft max . professor b : well , u not sure . phd a : yeah . what what if you right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? professor b : well , uh , phd c : that 's what phd a : right , ok . that 's a good point . professor b : yeah . now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that i i i the the fact i i it 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions . phd d : it may not be it phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah , for instance . but i bu yeah . so that 's maybe a problem with what i was just saying . but but i i guess phd a : but if you were gon na put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? phd c : so , m yeah . professor b : yeah . well , we just started working with it . but these are these are some good ideas i think . phd c : well , i 'm yeah . professor b : i think yeah . phd c : so . but i do n't know . phd a : which is professor b : yeah . phd c : but well . phd a : when when do you leave ? professor b : so i phd a : ah , ok , ok . so that 's you wo n't be at the next three of these meetings . is that right ? when do you go back ? </s>
<s> what did the professor think about the neural net ? </s> professor b : test . hmm . let 's see . move it bit . test ? test ? ok , i guess it 's alright . so , let 's see . yeah , barry 's not here and dave 's not here . um , i can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that dave and i submitted this asru . yeah . so . um . yeah , it 's it 's interesting . i mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine db . so , phd a : you mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ? professor b : yeah . yeah . um and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too . um , i know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at ogi . um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , { comment } the the aurora htk system baseline system { comment } and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the sri system , was that the sri system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . and the , uh , aurora htk , it was like twenty . phd d : yep . s sixty - four . professor b : for some reason , uh , dave thought it was twenty , phd d : sixt - s sixty - four . professor b : oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the fft ? phd d : yeah , i mean , make it a hundred or so ? professor b : would that be more like well , you 'd think that 'd be more like speechdat - car , i guess , in terms of the noise . the speechdat - car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . and and ti - digits maybe is not so much as mm - hmm . ok . well , maybe it 's not a big deal . but , um anyway , that was just something we wondered about . but , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . but , um but it 's still pretty noisy . even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . the signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing . uh , for the stationary kind of stuff . um , but , um , it , uh i guess , i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . and , uh , so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . and then um , i think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . phd a : oh . wow . professor b : yeah . yeah . so . uh , it might even be sooner . uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? yeah , i do n't know if he 's before it might even be in a week . phd a : so , i huh . i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester professor b : week and a half . phd a : but they 'll do it any time , huh ? professor b : they seem to be well , the semester actually is starting up . phd a : yikes . professor b : so they do it right at the beginning of the semester . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah . so , uh yep . i mean , that that was sort of one i mean , the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . and but if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set i thought that one thing with the htk is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . so even if we had a hundred times as much data , we would n't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many gaussians or anything . so , um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data . phd c : mm - hmm . phd d : mmm , yeah . professor b : so . that 's sort of what we found . phd a : i , um uh , started working on the uh mississippi state recognizer . so , i got in touch with joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . phd d : oh , ok . ok , great . phd a : and he gave me all of the pointers and everything that i needed . and so i downloaded the , um there were two things , uh , that they had to download . one was the , uh , i guess the software . and another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that . and it compiled fine . phd d : oh , eh , great . phd a : and , um , i grabbed the sample stuff but i have n't , uh , compiled it . and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . phd d : ok . oh , ok . f yeah , ok . professor b : uh but it 's still worth , i think , just since you know , just chatting with joe about the issue . uh @ @ { comment } you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , phd d : because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . phd a : yeah , susi or whatever it was phd d : that 's good . professor b : so and jeff , uh the two jeffs were what was it using before ? phd d : yeah , it was actually no . not i mean , it was just the noisy features i guess . phd c : um this is what we get after this so , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the lda filter . um , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , um , nine frames of of six features from c - zero to c - fives , plus the first derivatives . and it has one hundred hidden units . professor b : twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . that 's great . phd c : um so it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . professor b : what 's the latency ? i i 'm confused . you started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? two - seventy . phd c : the two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um no , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . um then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . so it adds forty milliseconds . um so it 's @ @ phd d : it 's like forty plus forty plus professor b : uh , p wait a minute . it 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech , phd c : twenty for the delta . so this is the features that are used by our network and then afterwards , you have to compute the delta on the , uh , main feature stream , professor b : oh , it does ? phd c : no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . it 's fifty . phd d : it 's professor b : fifty . alright . so and then y then you do n't have that additive ok . and you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ? i mean mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . it could be eighty and and probably do @ @ phd a : uh wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? two hundred ? so , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b : uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . professor b : well , it 's i think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got . phd c : and our system was forty - nine , but with the neural network . it would phd d : yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal . the proposal - one . it was forty - four , actually . professor b : yeah . yeah . and we still do n't have the neural net in . so so it 's you know . so it 's we 're we 're doing better . but but , uh uh , i mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . so . um , yeah . so , our , um yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on speechdat - car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really , um i think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . i mean , it 's still terri yeah . probably half . good ! phd d : it 's almost an average somewhere around phd a : so that 's sort of the best you could hope for . professor b : probably . yeah . so fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old vad . that 's great . phd a : that 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? phd c : but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . phd a : oh , yeah , i was n't necessarily saying it should be better . i 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel phd c : but it 's worse . uh - huh . professor b : so i wonder , um , well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ? phd c : um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the yeah , it 's the same training set , so it 's timit with the ti - digits ' , uh , noises , uh , added . professor b : i the other thing is , i mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different , right ? so , um , uh , for instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd a : so you tried the global klt before professor b : could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd a : what is the you said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? what 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b : oh , i know what i was gon na say . phd a : so i i i do n't understand , professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd a : so you 're saying , add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net ? professor b : yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . and again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point . much less than that , it was worse , phd d : so it had like all these different conditions of s n rs , actually in their training set of neural net . then it 's something to do . professor b : i mean , the macrophone data , um , i think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . and , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . i mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . so it 's not the same . i do n't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but i think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it does n't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set . um i mean , what we were uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits , even though there , again , these m macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . i mean , we were n't talking over a telephone here . but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c : mm - hmm . yep . yeah , actually to s eh , what i observed in the hm case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . it it doubles . when i added the num the neural network it doubles the number of deletions . yeah , so i do n't you know how to interpret that , but , mmm professor b : yeah . me either . phd c : they p stayed the same , they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . phd a : uh - huh . phd c : but yeah . i mean , but without the neural network it 's well , it 's better . it 's just when we add the neural networks . it was b a little bit worse . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd a : you know , i 've been wondering about something . in the , um a lot of the , um the hub - five systems , um , recently have been using lda . and and they , um they run lda on the features right before they train the models . so there 's the the lda is is right there before the h m phd d : uh , this lda is different from the lda that you are talking about . the lda that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , { comment } and then do an lda on it , and then feed it to hmm . phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? yeah . right , it 's the it 's right . the so yeah , so it 's sort of like the tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear lda . professor b : uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . and pca does n't do that . it pac - pca low - order pca throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gon na be helpful just because they 're small , basically . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : and so , uh , stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . so you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that does n't have that , phd a : uh - huh . professor b : there was enough of a difference , i guess , between the testing and training . but by having them both there the fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gon na help you . and some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a : so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : that i i i think that 's counter to that idea . now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things . we do n't really know what 's gon na work best . but if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . phd a : yeah . exactly . i mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the hub - five system , and , um , andreas and i talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , `` well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the lda in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . professor b : well , i think that 's a good idea . or tha that 's a yeah . yeah . no , well , that 's a good idea . i i phd a : we just want to show . professor b : i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . phd a : yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , and so , i that 's what made me wonder about this , professor b : well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , but but but , uh , phd a : yeah , what i mean is it 's it 's like in the hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , you know , lda on their features . and so . phd c : it 's the transformation they 're estimating on well , they are trained on the same data as the final hmm are . phd a : yeah , so it 's different . yeah , exactly . cuz they do n't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , but um . phd d : so , yeah , i 've been exploring a parallel vad without neural network with , like , less latency using snr and energy , um , after the cleaning up . so what i 'd been trying was , um , uh after the b after the noise compensation , n i was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . so that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . and if it is n if it is close to zero , which is so it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . so i was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . uh , the advantage being like it does n't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can g and it gave me like , uh , one point one more than one percent relative improvement . so , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . so it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement , uh , at a l lower delay . professor b : but i d i 'm sorry , phd d : it still has the median filter . professor b : so it still has most of the delay , phd d : yeah , so yeah , so that 's the yeah . so we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . professor b : yeah . so if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing . phd d : the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , phd a : so you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? right , ok . that 's a good point . professor b : is too high . phd d : it may not be it yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . phd c : yeah . yeah , like the entropy of the the output , phd a : but if you were gon na put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? phd d : because it 's it has a high rate energy professor b : yeah . well , we just started working with it . but these are these are some good ideas i think . phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? uh - huh . ah , ok , ok . professor b : and uh , that 's during eurospeech . phd a : oh , oh , right . ok . professor b : yeah . yeah . so . cool . phd d : p s it 's like yeah , it 's tentatively all full . yeah . uh , that 's a proposed date , i guess . </s>
<s> what did the team discuss about the most noisy cases ? </s> phd d : yep . yep . professor b : yeah . so . um . yeah , it 's it 's interesting . i mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine db . so , phd a : you mean , from the actual , uh , recordings ? professor b : yeah . yeah . um and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too . um , i know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at ogi . um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , { comment } the the aurora htk system baseline system { comment } and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the sri system , was that the sri system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . and the , uh , aurora htk , it was like twenty . phd d : yeah , if you 're using the baseline . yeah . so it 's it 's a weight on the ball spectrum . triangular weighting . professor b : right . ok . um ok . so that 's that 's a little different than dave thought , i think . but but , um , still , it 's possible that we 're getting in some more noise . so i wonder , is it @ @ was there their experimentation with , uh , say , throwing away that filter or something ? and , uh and on and on the , um , um , ti - digits also ? mmm . that 'd be something to look at sometime because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room . would that be more like well , you 'd think that 'd be more like speechdat - car , i guess , in terms of the noise . the speechdat - car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . and and ti - digits maybe is not so much as mm - hmm . ok . well , maybe it 's not a big deal . but , um anyway , that was just something we wondered about . but , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . but , um but it 's still pretty noisy . even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . the signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . well , we got a a video projector in here , uh , and , uh which we keep on during every every session we record , phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : um , but , um , it , uh i guess , i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . and , uh , so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . phd a : huh . i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester phd d : mmm , yeah . phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : and he gave me all of the pointers and everything that i needed . and so i downloaded the , um there were two things , uh , that they had to download . one was the , uh , i guess the software . and another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that . and it compiled fine . phd d : and , uh , on that , i mean , they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those professor b : so they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? ok . so now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we ca n't modify these parameters . um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . but if if , uh if there is n't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . phd d : because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . phd a : yeah . yeah , i that was a particular version . professor b : but , uh , i noticed , just glancing at the , uh , hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing i do n't know well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . uh , so he did he did his phd on dynamic bayes - nets , uh , for for speech recognition . he had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the in the production system , and , um phd d : yeah , it was actually no . not i mean , it was just the noisy features i guess . phd c : noisy noisy features . um this is what we get after this so , actually , we , yeah , here the features are noise compensated and there is also the lda filter . um , and then it 's a pretty small neural network which use , um , nine frames of of six features from c - zero to c - fives , plus the first derivatives . and it has one hundred hidden units . yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . phd c : hidden and um so it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . um , after that , um , you have the um , filtering of the silence probabilities . which is a million filter it , and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay . so , um um so it 's @ @ the vad use , uh , lda filtered features also . professor b : ah . so in that case there is n't too much in parallel . uh phd c : no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . but well , we could probably put the delta , um , before on - line normalization . it should not that make a big difference , phd a : what if you used a smaller window for the delta ? professor b : uh then then it could go in parallel . and then y then you do n't have that additive phd c : so . it should not make professor b : uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . it would professor b : yeah . yeah . and we still do n't have the neural net in . so so it 's phd c : so , if you use , like , an idl vad , uh , for dropping the frames , mmm yeah . well , these features actually . and the other stream is the output of a neural network , using as input , also , these , um , cleaned mfcc . um phd a : uh - huh . phd c : but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . professor b : right ? so so , um or or suppose it was n't completely terrible , but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had , except it was noisier . phd c : mm - hmm . um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the professor b : mm - hmm . phd c : yeah , it 's the same training set , so it 's timit with the ti - digits ' , uh , noises , uh , added . professor b : mm - hmm . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : i the other thing is , i mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different , right ? so , um , uh , for instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : what if you did the would it make sense to do the klt on the full set of combined features ? instead of just on the phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : and i guess if the these are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into , um , the , uh the hmm . could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd c : mm - hmm . yeah , i see . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : yeah . so we found this this , uh this macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : so you 're saying , add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net ? professor b : yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . much more than that , it was n't much better . hmm . phd c : mm - hmm . phd d : so it had like all these different conditions of s n rs , actually in their training set of neural net . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . you mean the the most noisy occurrences on speechdat - car might be a lot more noisy than phd d : mm - hmm . of that i mean , the snr after the noise compensation of the speechdat - car . so the net saw all the snr @ @ conditions . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , it is . but , i 'm saying , there could be some some issues of professor b : right ? i mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that was n't there before , phd d : hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , the macrophone data , um , i think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . i mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . so it 's not the same . i do n't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but i think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it does n't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set . um i mean , what we were uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits , even though there , again , these m macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . i mean , we were n't talking over a telephone here . but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c : mm - hmm . yep . they p stayed the same , they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . but yeah . i mean , but without the neural network it 's well , it 's better . it 's just when we add the neural networks . the feature are the same except that mm - hmm . and `` street `` is n't it was b a little bit worse . than just the features , yeah . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : they were doing similar enough things . well , i still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing . and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . phd c : mm - hmm . hmm . phd d : uh , this lda is different from the lda that you are talking about . the lda that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , { comment } and then do an lda on it , so this is a two dimensional tile . and the lda that we are f applying is only in time , not in frequency high cost frequency . so it 's like more like a filtering in time , rather than doing a r phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? the tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear lda . phd c : yeah . it 's phd a : but i mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , phd c : uh . mm - hmm . yeah , i know . that that yeah . well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using pca , but phd a : uh - huh . phd c : yeah , it might be that lda could be better . professor b : and so , uh , stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . so you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that does n't have that , and putting those in together . and that that seem so it 's kind of like a combination of the uh , what , uh , dan has been calling , you know , a feature uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something . it 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things . and that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it did n't help at all in this particular case . there was enough of a difference , i guess , between the testing and training . but by having them both there the fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gon na help you . phd a : mm - hmm . professor b : and some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a : so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : that i i i think that 's counter to that idea . um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . phd a : right . yeah . well y yeah . exactly . i mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the hub - five system , and , um , andreas and i talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , `` well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the lda in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . professor b : i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . phd a : yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : and , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at iir filters , and you know , i mean , uh , so i think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it . phd a : yeah , and everybody 's putting that on their systems now , and so , i that 's what made me wonder about this , professor b : well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd c : it 's the transformation they 're estimating on well , they are trained on the same data as the final hmm are . phd a : yeah , so it 's different . yeah , exactly . cuz they do n't have these , you know , mismatches that that you guys have . phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , phd c : mm - hmm . phd a : but um . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : it still has the median filter . professor b : so it still has most of the delay , phd c : mm - hmm . professor b : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : yeah , so yeah , so that 's the yeah . so we 've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also . because they did that itself professor b : yeah . so if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing . phd d : the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , we have the vad information also available at the back - end . so if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes i mean because most of it is sil i mean , we have dropped some silence f we have dropped so silence frames ? no , we have n't dropped silence frames still . the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . so , by having an additional , uh , feature which says `` this is speech and this is nonspeech `` , i mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . phd a : so you 're saying , feed that , also , into the neural net . yeah . yeah . right . professor b : you could feed it into the neural net . the other thing { comment } you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , { comment } based on the fact that you have a silence probability . phd d : mm - hmm . professor b : i mean , let 's put it this way . i mean , y you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters phd a : right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? professor b : well , yeah . but this other thing is n't perfect . so that you bring in some information from the net itself . phd a : right , ok . that 's a good point . phd c : yeah . but so i might maybe look at , is it due to the fact that um , the probability of the silence at the output of the network , is , uh , phd d : it may not be it yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . or , i mean , different among classes . phd c : yeah . yeah , like the entropy of the the output , professor b : yeah , for instance . phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : but if you were gon na put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? professor b : it 's kind of done in i mean , some of the things are , not in parallel , but certainly , it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net . at some point where the vad is saying it 's actually speech . phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? phd c : i 'm thinking , also , a w about dan 's work where he he trained a network , not on phoneme targets but on the hmm state targets . and it was giving s slightly better results . professor b : but it sounds to me like , uh , looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion on vad results </s> phd a : ok , we 're going . phd c : eight , eight ? phd d : this is three . phd c : three . professor b : test . hmm . let 's see . move it bit . test ? test ? ok , i guess it 's alright . so , let 's see . yeah , barry 's not here and dave 's not here . um , i can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that dave and i submitted this asru . yeah . so . um . yeah , it 's it 's interesting . i mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine db . so , yeah . yeah . um and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too . um , i know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at ogi . um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , { comment } the the aurora htk system baseline system { comment } and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the sri system , was that the sri system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . and the , uh , aurora htk , it was like twenty . phd d : yep . s sixty - four . s sixty - four . professor b : sixty - four ? uh . for some reason , uh , dave thought it was twenty , phd d : sixt - s sixty - four . so anything less than sixty - four is zero . professor b : oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the fft ? right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , uh , too , uh , low . phd d : yeah , i mean , make it a hundred or so ? yeah . so i tried a hundred to four k . yeah . professor b : mm - hmm . ok . well , maybe it 's not a big deal . but , um anyway , that was just something we wondered about . but , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . but , um but it 's still pretty noisy . even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . the signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : but but we thought it was n't a bad thing . phd a : i see . professor b : um , but , um , it , uh i guess , i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . and , uh , so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . and then um , i think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . phd a : oh . wow . professor b : yeah . yeah . so . uh , it might even be sooner . uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? yeah , i do n't know if he 's before it might even be in a week . phd a : so , i huh . i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester professor b : week and a half . phd a : but they 'll do it any time , huh ? professor b : they seem to be well , the semester actually is starting up . phd a : is it already ? professor b : yeah , the semester 's late late august they start here . phd a : yikes . professor b : so they do it right at the beginning of the semester . yeah . so , uh yep . i mean , that that was sort of one i mean , the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . and but if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set i thought that one thing with the htk is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . so even if we had a hundred times as much data , we would n't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many gaussians or anything . so , um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data . so . that 's sort of what we found . phd a : i , um uh , started working on the uh mississippi state recognizer . so , i got in touch with joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . phd d : oh , ok . ok , great . phd a : and he gave me all of the pointers and everything that i needed . and so i downloaded the , um there were two things , uh , that they had to download . one was the , uh , i guess the software . and another wad was a , um , sort of like a sample a sample run . so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that . and it compiled fine . phd d : eight . phd a : no problems . phd d : oh , eh , great . phd a : and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . professor b : uh @ @ { comment } you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it . um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , phd d : because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . phd a : yeah , susi or whatever it was phd d : ok , that 's fine . that 's good . professor b : but , uh , i noticed , just glancing at the , uh , hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing i do n't know well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . oh . uh , he he , uh he was here for a couple years and he , uh got his phd . he and he 's , uh , been at ibm for the last couple years . uh , so he did he did his phd on dynamic bayes - nets , uh , for for speech recognition . he had some continuity built into the model , presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the in the production system , and , um what was it using before ? twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . phd c : it should be ok . so the previous syst it 's based on the system that has a fifty - three point sixty - six percent improvement . it 's the same system . the only thing that changed is the n a p eh a es the estimation of the silence probabilities . professor b : that 's great . what 's the latency ? i i 'm confused . you started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? phd c : with two an two hundred and seventy . professor b : two - seventy . phd c : the two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um no , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . um then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . so it adds forty milliseconds . professor b : and then forty phd c : mmm . forty this forty plus twenty , plus one hundred . so it 's two - twenty . twenty for the delta . professor b : oh , it does ? phd c : no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . it 's fifty . professor b : fifty . alright . so and then y then you do n't have that additive ok . and you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ? i mean phd a : is two hundred the d professor b : mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . it could be eighty and and probably do @ @ phd a : uh wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? two hundred ? professor b : i mean , if it 's two if if it 's , uh if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . if it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back . phd a : so , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . no . i just this is the first try . yeah . the best was fifty - four point five . and our system was forty - nine , but with the neural network . phd a : wow . so this is almost ten percent . phd c : it would phd d : yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal . the proposal - one . it was forty - four , actually . professor b : you know . so it 's we 're we 're doing better . i mean , we 're getting better recognition . i mean , i 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either , but but but , uh uh , i mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . so . um , yeah . so , our , um yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on speechdat - car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really , um i think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . i mean , it 's still terri yeah . probably half . good ! phd d : it 's almost an average somewhere around o o or the best we can get . phd c : the best that we can get i that means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances . then you can go up to sixty - two percent error rate reduction , globally . professor b : probably . yeah . so fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old vad . and , uh and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating vad . and fifty - seven is what you got with the real vad . that 's great . phd c : so , d i it 's forty - five . professor b : so it 's you have seventy - three features , phd a : that 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? why twenty - eight ? phd c : uh . it 's i i i it 's because it 's what we did for the first proposal . we tested , uh , trying to go down but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . so , uh , we have to find a way to decrease the number of features . um phd a : oh , yeah , i was n't necessarily saying it should be better . i 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel phd c : but it 's worse . professor b : so having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they are n't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse . i mean , you 're right . if you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . but but it 's it does n't necessarily work that way . so i wonder , um , well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ? phd c : um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the phd d : so , was the training set same as the p the february proposal ? ok . phd c : yeah , it 's the same training set , so it 's timit with the ti - digits ' , uh , noises , uh , added . professor b : could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd a : what is the you said there was a limit of sixty features or something ? what 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b : oh , i know what i was gon na say . phd a : so i i i do n't understand , professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . phd d : what are the s n rs in the training set , timit ? phd a : so you 're saying , add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net ? professor b : i mean , the macrophone data , um , i think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones . and , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . i mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . so it 's not the same . i do n't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but i think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it does n't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set . um i mean , what we were uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits , even though there , again , these m macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . i mean , we were n't talking over a telephone here . but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c : yeah , actually to s eh , what i observed in the hm case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases . it it doubles . professor b : yeah . me either . phd c : they p stayed the same , they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . phd a : uh - huh . phd d : `` babble . `` professor b : was it about the same ? uh , w i phd c : it was b a little bit worse . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd d : and then feed it to hmm . phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? professor b : uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . and pca does n't do that . it pac - pca low - order pca throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gon na be helpful just because they 're small , basically . but , uh , the problem is , training sets are n't perfect and testing sets are different . so you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it lda or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gon na be g getting is is something else . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : and so , uh , stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . so you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that does n't have that , phd a : uh - huh . professor b : there was enough of a difference , i guess , between the testing and training . but by having them both there the fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gon na help you . and some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a : so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things . we do n't really know what 's gon na work best . but if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . well , i think that 's a good idea . phd a : we just want to show . professor b : i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd a : yeah , what i mean is it 's it 's like in the hub - five evaluations , you know , and you read the system descriptions and everybody 's got , you know , lda on their features . phd c : it 's the transformation they 're estimating on well , they are trained on the same data as the final hmm are . phd a : so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , professor b : i think you were . does something . it does n't work as well . yeah . yeah . phd d : so , yeah , i 've been exploring a parallel vad without neural network with , like , less latency using snr and energy , um , after the cleaning up . so what i 'd been trying was , um , uh after the b after the noise compensation , n i was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . so that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . and if it is n if it is close to zero , which is so it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . so i was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . uh , the advantage being like it does n't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can g and it gave me like , uh , one point one more than one percent relative improvement . so , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . so it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement , uh , at a l lower delay . professor b : but i d i 'm sorry , so it still has most of the delay , phd d : the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . so , by having an additional , uh , feature which says `` this is speech and this is nonspeech `` , i mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . professor b : you could feed it into the neural net . the other thing { comment } you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , { comment } based on the fact that you have a silence probability . well , u not sure . phd a : right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? right , ok . that 's a good point . professor b : is too high . cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? am i missing something here ? yeah . well , we just started working with it . but these are these are some good ideas i think . phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? phd c : mm - hmm . oh , it would be yeah . around five percent better , i guess . if if i phd a : uh - huh . yeah . so this would be sixty - two ? professor b : sixty - two . phd c : sixty - two , yeah . phd a : all the other ones were five percent , professor b : oh , well . i 'm talking about next week . i 'm leaving leaving next wednesday . phd a : ah , ok , ok . oh , oh , right . ok . so , uh , you 're gon na be gone for the next three weeks or something ? professor b : i 'm gone for two and a half weeks starting starting next wed - late next wednesday . phd a : so that 's you wo n't be at the next three of these meetings . is that right ? when do you go back ? phd d : thirty - first , august . professor b : yeah , it was supposed to be november fifteenth . has anybody heard anything different ? phd c : i do n't know . the meeting in is the five and six of december . so </s>
<s> what did the professor think about vad latency ? </s> phd a : ok , we 're going . phd c : eight , eight ? phd d : this is three . yep . yep . professor b : yeah . so . um . yeah , it 's it 's interesting . i mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine db . so , yeah . yeah . um and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too . um , i know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at ogi . um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , { comment } the the aurora htk system baseline system { comment } and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the sri system , was that the sri system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . and the , uh , aurora htk , it was like twenty . phd d : yep . s sixty - four . s sixty - four . professor b : for some reason , uh , dave thought it was twenty , phd d : sixt - s sixty - four . so anything less than sixty - four is zero . professor b : oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the fft ? phd d : and that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz . professor b : right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , uh , too , uh , low . phd d : yeah , i mean , make it a hundred or so ? professor b : would that be more like well , you 'd think that 'd be more like speechdat - car , i guess , in terms of the noise . the speechdat - car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . and and ti - digits maybe is not so much as mm - hmm . ok . well , maybe it 's not a big deal . but , um anyway , that was just something we wondered about . but , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . but , um but it 's still pretty noisy . even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . the signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : um , but , um , it , uh i guess , i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . and , uh , so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . and then um , i think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . phd a : oh . wow . professor b : yeah . yeah . so . uh , it might even be sooner . uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth , seventeenth ? yeah , i do n't know if he 's before it might even be in a week . phd a : so , i huh . i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester professor b : week and a half . phd a : but they 'll do it any time , huh ? professor b : they seem to be well , the semester actually is starting up . phd a : yikes . professor b : so they do it right at the beginning of the semester . phd a : yeah . professor b : yeah . so , uh yep . i mean , that that was sort of one i mean , the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set . uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot . and but if you had a a really big training set , a recognizer , uh , system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set i thought that one thing with the htk is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of aurora , we have all those parameters just set as they are . so even if we had a hundred times as much data , we would n't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many gaussians or anything . so , um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data . uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data . phd c : mm - hmm . phd d : mmm , yeah . professor b : so . that 's sort of what we found . phd a : i , um uh , started working on the uh mississippi state recognizer . so , i got in touch with joe and and , uh , from your email and things like that . phd d : oh , ok . ok , great . eight . oh , eh , great . phd a : and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . phd d : ok . oh , ok . f yeah , ok . professor b : so they 're set they 're setting it based on that ? uh but it 's still worth , i think , just since you know , just chatting with joe about the issue . phd a : yeah . ok . professor b : um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features . but if if , uh if there is n't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in . phd a : yeah . ok . phd d : yeah , ok . because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . yeah , ok . ok , that 's fine . that 's good . professor b : but , uh , i noticed , just glancing at the , uh , hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing i do n't know well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition . what was it using before ? phd c : yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . phd a : ah . ok . professor b : that 's great . phd c : um so it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . professor b : what 's the latency ? i i 'm confused . you started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? two - seventy . phd c : the two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um no , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . um then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . so it adds forty milliseconds . professor b : and then forty phd c : mmm . forty this forty plus twenty , plus one hundred . so it 's two - twenty . twenty for the delta . professor b : oh , it does ? phd c : no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . it 's fifty . professor b : fifty . alright . so and then y then you do n't have that additive ok . and you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ? i mean phd a : is two hundred the d professor b : mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount . it could be eighty and and probably do @ @ phd a : uh wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? two hundred ? professor b : i mean , if it 's two if if it 's , uh if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . if it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back . phd a : so , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b : uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . phd a : ah , ok . professor b : he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . yeah . the best was fifty - four point five . it would phd d : yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal . the proposal - one . it was forty - four , actually . professor b : you know . so it 's we 're we 're doing better . but but , uh uh , i mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . so . um , yeah . so , our , um yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on speechdat - car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really , um i think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . i mean , it 's still terri yeah . probably half . good ! phd d : o o or the best we can get . phd a : so that 's sort of the best you could hope for . professor b : probably . yeah . so fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old vad . and , uh and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating vad . and fifty - seven is what you got with the real vad . that 's great . phd c : so , d i it 's forty - five . phd a : that 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? phd c : uh . it 's i i i it 's because it 's what we did for the first proposal . we tested , uh , trying to go down but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . professor b : right ? in that case you would n't necessarily expect it to be better at all . phd a : oh , yeah , i was n't necessarily saying it should be better . i 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel phd c : but it 's worse . uh - huh . professor b : so having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they are n't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse . i mean , you 're right . if you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . but but it 's it does n't necessarily work that way . phd c : um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the phd d : so , was the training set same as the p the february proposal ? ok . professor b : i the other thing is , i mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different , right ? so , um , uh , for instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd a : what 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd a : so you 're saying , add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net ? phd d : hmm . mm - hmm . then it 's something to do . phd c : yeah . mm - hmm . professor b : and , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . i mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . so it 's not the same . i do n't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but i think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it does n't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set . um i mean , what we were uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits , even though there , again , these m macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . i mean , we were n't talking over a telephone here . but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c : mm - hmm . yep . professor b : yeah . me either . phd c : they p stayed the same , they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . phd a : uh - huh . phd d : `` babble . `` professor b : was it about the same ? uh , w i phd c : it was b a little bit worse . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd d : and then feed it to hmm . phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? professor b : uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . and pca does n't do that . it pac - pca low - order pca throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gon na be helpful just because they 're small , basically . phd a : right . professor b : but , uh , the problem is , training sets are n't perfect and testing sets are different . so you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it lda or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space but what you 're really gon na be g getting is is something else . phd a : uh - huh . professor b : and so , uh , stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not . so you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make , and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that does n't have that , phd a : uh - huh . professor b : there was enough of a difference , i guess , between the testing and training . but by having them both there the fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gon na help you . and some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a : right . so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things . we do n't really know what 's gon na work best . but if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . though , maybe not . well , i think that 's a good idea . phd a : we just want to show . professor b : i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . phd a : yeah . mm - hmm . yeah . professor b : well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years , phd a : and so . so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , professor b : i mean , part of why i i think part of why you were getting into the klt y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? so you were just trying i think you r i mean , this is it does n't have the lda aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? i think you were . phd d : so , yeah , i 've been exploring a parallel vad without neural network with , like , less latency using snr and energy , um , after the cleaning up . so what i 'd been trying was , um , uh after the b after the noise compensation , n i was trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energies , that is , cl after clean and before clean . so that if if they are , like , pretty c close to one , which means it 's speech . and if it is n if it is close to zero , which is so it 's like a scale @ @ probability value . so i was trying , uh , with full band and multiple bands , m ps uh separating them to different frequency bands and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them . uh , the advantage being like it does n't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can g and it gave me like , uh , one point one more than one percent relative improvement . so , from fifty - three point six it went to fifty f four point eight . so it 's , like , only slightly more than a percent improvement , uh , at a l lower delay . professor b : but i d i 'm sorry , so it still has most of the delay , phd d : because they did that itself the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , phd a : ok . ok . professor b : well , u not sure . phd a : right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? right , ok . that 's a good point . professor b : is too high . phd d : it may not be it yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . professor b : cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? am i missing something here ? phd d : because it 's it has a high rate energy phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? professor b : sixty - two . phd c : sixty - two , yeah . phd a : uh - huh . ah , ok , ok . oh , oh , right . ok . professor b : yeah . yeah . so . cool . yeah , it was supposed to be november fifteenth . has anybody heard anything different ? </s>
<s> what did phd c say about the breakdown of the latency ? </s> professor b : test . hmm . let 's see . move it bit . test ? test ? ok , i guess it 's alright . so , let 's see . yeah , barry 's not here and dave 's not here . um , i can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that dave and i submitted this asru . yeah . so . um . yeah , it 's it 's interesting . i mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation , and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well . uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio and it 's , uh , about nine db . so , yeah . yeah . um and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too . um , i know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at ogi . um , but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , { comment } the the aurora htk system baseline system { comment } and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the sri system , was that the sri system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass . and the , uh , aurora htk , it was like twenty . phd d : s sixty - four . professor b : for some reason , uh , dave thought it was twenty , phd d : so the , uh , center would be somewhere around like hundred sixt - s sixty - four . professor b : oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the fft ? phd d : and that 's always worse than using sixty - four hertz . professor b : right , but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , uh , too , uh , low . phd d : yeah , i mean , make it a hundred or so ? professor b : and on and on the , um , um , ti - digits also ? would that be more like well , you 'd think that 'd be more like speechdat - car , i guess , in terms of the noise . the speechdat - car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it . and and ti - digits maybe is not so much as mm - hmm . ok . well , maybe it 's not a big deal . but , um anyway , that was just something we wondered about . but , um , uh , certainly a lot of the noise , uh , is , uh , below a hundred hertz . uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room . but , um but it 's still pretty noisy . even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy . the signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad . um , but , um , it , uh i guess , i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise . and , uh , so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it . and then um , i think in about , um , a little less than two weeks . phd a : so , i huh . i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester professor b : week and a half . so they do it right at the beginning of the semester . so . that 's sort of what we found . phd a : and so i have n't grabbed the latest one that he just , uh , put out yet . phd d : ok . oh , ok . f yeah , ok . professor b : uh but it 's still worth , i think , just since you know , just chatting with joe about the issue . well , it 's not a secret . i mean , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody , but i think i think that , um um , it 's probably best to start talking with him just to um , if you get ten people in involved in it there 'll be a lot of perspectives based on , you know , how uh but , i mean , i think it all should come up eventually , phd d : because he there was some mail r saying that it 's may not be stable for linux and all those . professor b : what was it using before ? phd d : yeah , it was actually no . not i mean , it was just the noisy features i guess . professor b : s so , i 'm i 'm sorry , there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ? twelve times nine inputs , and a hundred , uh , hidden . phd a : ah . ok . phd c : which now is based on , uh , cleaned features . professor b : that 's great . phd c : um so it 's it 's not bad , but the problem is still that the latency is too large . professor b : what 's the latency ? phd c : because um the the latency of the vad is two hundred and twenty milliseconds . and , uh , the vad is used uh , i for on - line normalization , and it 's used before the delta computation . so if you add these components it goes t to a hundred and seventy , right ? professor b : i i 'm confused . you started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ? two - seventy . phd c : the two - twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um no , it 's forty milliseconds for t for the , uh , uh , cleaning of the speech . um then there is , um , the neural network which use nine frames . so it adds forty milliseconds . um so it 's @ @ phd d : it 's like forty plus forty plus phd c : mmm . forty this forty plus twenty , plus one hundred . professor b : forty p phd c : so it 's two - twenty . professor b : uh , p wait a minute . it 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech , phd c : so . forty cleaning . twenty for the delta . phd d : at th at the input . i mean , that 's at the input to the net . professor b : ten milliseconds for lda filter , and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ? yeah . no , i mean , the after the noise part , the forty the the other hundred and eighty well , i mean , wait a minute . some of this is , uh is , uh is in parallel , is n't it ? i mean , the lda oh , you have the lda as part of the v d - uh , vad ? or phd c : no . there is , um , just downsampling , upsampling , and the lda . phd a : could that help a little bit ? i mean , i guess there 's a lot of things you could do to professor b : and then y then you do n't have that additive ok . and you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred , right ? i mean phd a : is two hundred the d uh wh - what 's the baseline you need to be under ? two hundred ? professor b : i mean , if it 's two if if it 's , uh if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty . if it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back . phd a : so , how do you know that what you have is too much if they 're still deciding ? professor b : uh , we do n't , but it 's just i mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it . he added a bit on , i guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the lva be in parallel . phd c : well , but i think the main thing , maybe , is the cleaning of the speech , which takes forty milliseconds or so . professor b : well , ten . and then forty for the other . phd c : no . i just this is the first try . professor b : i mean , you have twenty for delta computation which y now you 're sort of doing twice , right ? but yo w were you doing that before ? so , what you have now is fort uh , forty for the the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the lda . that 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel , well , it 's i think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got . phd c : it would phd d : yeah , so this is this is like the first proposal . the proposal - one . it was forty - four , actually . professor b : but but , uh uh , i mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better , and , you know . so . um , yeah . so , our , um yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on speechdat - car which is a hard task , cuz it 's really , um i think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be . i mean , it 's still terri yeah . probably half . good ! phd d : it 's almost an average somewhere around o o or the best we can get . phd a : so that 's sort of the best you could hope for . professor b : probably . yeah . so fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old vad . and , uh and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating vad . and fifty - seven is what you got with the real vad . that 's great . phd c : for the decision phd a : right . ok . phd c : compared to these numbers , yeah . um , so , d i it 's forty - five . phd a : that 's how you get down to twenty - eight ? phd c : uh . it 's i i i it 's because it 's what we did for the first proposal . we tested , uh , trying to go down but we have to for sure , we have to go down , because the limit is now sixty features . phd a : oh , yeah , i was n't necessarily saying it should be better . i 'm just surprised that you 're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel phd c : but it 's worse . professor b : so having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they are n't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse . i mean , you 're right . if you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help . but but it 's it does n't necessarily work that way . phd c : um , i do n't know . i 'm surprised , because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch , as it was the case for the phd d : so , was the training set same as the p the february proposal ? ok . professor b : i the other thing is , i mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different , right ? so , um , uh , for instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ? phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor b : and i guess if the these are all so all of these seventy - three features are going into , um , the , uh the hmm . could . i yeah , but the other thing i was thinking was , um uh , now i lost track of what i was thinking . but . phd a : what 's the relation between that limit and the , um , forty - eight uh , forty eight hundred bits per second ? professor b : the issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gon na be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth . and so , uh , they felt they wanted to set a limit . so they chose sixty . some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters and and that bothered some other people . u and so they just chose that . i i i think it 's kind of r arbitrary too . but but that 's that 's kind of what was chosen . i i remembered what i was going to say . what i was going to say is that , um , maybe maybe with the noise removal , uh , these things are now more correlated . so you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , uh , within themselves , but they 're pretty correlated with one another . so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one klt over everything , to de - correlate it . phd d : what are the s n rs in the training set , timit ? phd a : so you 're saying , add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net ? professor b : yeah , that 's the only place that we can train . much more than that , it was n't much better . hmm . phd c : yeah . @ @ ? phd d : right ? so you i well , it it 's like the high mismatch of the speechdat - car after cleaning up , maybe having more noise than the the training set of timit after clean s after you do the noise clean - up . so it had like all these different conditions of s n rs , actually in their training set of neural net . phd c : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : and is it something to do with the mismatch that that 's created after the cleaning up , like the high mismatch mm - hmm . of that i mean , the snr after the noise compensation of the speechdat - car . so the net saw all the snr @ @ conditions . professor b : right ? i mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that was n't there before , phd d : hmm . mm - hmm . well , i i do n't know . i i just that could be seen from the ti - digits , uh , testing condition because , um , the noises are from the ti - digits , right ? noise so cleaning up the ti - digits and if the performance goes down in the ti - digits mismatch high mismatch like this professor b : and , um , so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions . i mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything . so it 's not the same . i do n't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car , but i think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it does n't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set . um i mean , what we were uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits , even though there , again , these m macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here . i mean , we were n't talking over a telephone here . but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing . phd c : they p stayed the same , they maybe they are a little bit uh , lower . and `` street `` is n't `` train station `` , yeah . it was b a little bit worse . professor b : so , until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net was n't helping at all . phd c : c cs . as soon as we added lda on - line normalization , and all these things , then professor b : and and the thing i i have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse . phd d : yeah , so it 's four . is i so either it 'll get cancelled out , or you 'll get , like , almost the same . professor b : yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out . phd a : you know , i 've been wondering about something . in the , um a lot of the , um the hub - five systems , um , recently have been using lda . and and they , um they run lda on the features right before they train the models . so there 's the the lda is is right there before the h m phd d : uh , this lda is different from the lda that you are talking about . the lda that you saying is , like , you take a block of features , like nine frames or something , { comment } and then do an lda on it , phd a : ah . ok . so what i what about , um i u what i w i mean , i do n't know if this is a good idea or not , but what if you put ran the other kind of lda , uh , on your features right before they go into the hmm ? yeah . right , it 's the it 's right . the so yeah , so it 's sort of like but i mean , w but the other features that you have , um , th the non - tandem ones , phd c : uh . mm - hmm . yeah , i know . that that yeah . well , in the proposal , they were transformed u using pca , but professor b : uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between . and pca does n't do that . it pac - pca low - order pca throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gon na be helpful just because they 're small , basically . and then , uh , you you discriminately train it , but you also take the path that that does n't have that , there was enough of a difference , i guess , between the testing and training . but by having them both there the fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gon na help you . and some of the time it 's going to hurt you , phd a : so you would n't necessarily then want to do lda on the non - tandem features because now you 're doing something to them that professor b : now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things . we do n't really know what 's gon na work best . but if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that . um , and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda . phd a : yeah . exactly . i mean , we , uh we were getting ready to do the tandem , uh , stuff for the hub - five system , and , um , andreas and i talked about it , and the idea w the thought was , `` well , uh , yeah , that i you know th the neural net should be better , but we should at least have uh , a number , you know , to show that we did try the lda in place of the neural net , so that we can you know , show a clear path . professor b : well , i think that 's a good idea . did did you do that i mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea . i mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them . phd a : and so . phd c : it 's the transformation they 're estimating on well , they are trained on the same data as the final hmm are . phd a : so that 's why i was wondering if maybe it 's not even a good idea . i do n't know . i i do n't know enough about it , professor b : i mean , part of why i i think part of why you were getting into the klt y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ? so you were just trying i think you r i mean , this is it does n't have the lda aspect but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ? but i d i 'm sorry , so it still has most of the delay , right . ok . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd d : so the i 'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the p clean up maybe , some , uh , correlation auto - correlation or some s additional features of to mainly the improvement of the vad . i 've been trying . professor b : now this this this , uh , `` before and after clean `` , it sounds like you think that 's a good feature . that that , it you th think that the , uh the i it appears to be a good feature , right ? yeah . so if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing . um , anybody has anybody you guys or or naren , uh , somebody , tried the , uh , um , second th second stream thing ? uh . phd d : oh , i just i just h put the second stream in place and , uh ran one experiment , but just like just to know that everything is fine . the uh , other thing i was wondering was , um , if the neural net , um , has any because of the different noise con unseen noise conditions for the neural net , where , like , you train it on those four noise conditions , while you are feeding it with , like , a additional some four plus some f few more conditions which it has n't seen , actually , professor b : wh - uh , the the vad what ? phd d : the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence . so , by having an additional , uh , feature which says `` this is speech and this is nonspeech `` , i mean , it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net . phd a : ok . ok . professor b : you could feed it into the neural net . the other thing { comment } you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , { comment } based on the fact that you have a silence probability . phd a : right . so , what if you then , uh since you know this , what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions ? professor b : but it 's @ @ well , no , you want to train on on the nonspeech also , because that 's part of what you 're learning in it , to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between . phd a : but i mean , if you 're gon na if you 're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision , uh , would then you do n't care about whether the net makes that distinction , right ? right , ok . that 's a good point . professor b : is too high . phd d : it may not be it yeah , it it may be too it 's too high in a sense , like , everything is more like a , um , flat probability . professor b : cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot , right ? am i missing something here ? phd a : but if you were gon na put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net , right ? phd d : because it 's it has a high rate energy professor b : yeah . well , we just started working with it . but these are these are some good ideas i think . phd a : for the tandem net you mean ? phd c : mmm . i was just thinking maybe about , like , generalized diphones , and come up with a a reasonable , not too large , set of context dependent units , and and yeah . and then anyway we would have to reduce this with the klt . mm - hmm . oh , it would be yeah . around five percent better , i guess . if if i phd a : uh - huh . yeah . so this would be sixty - two ? phd c : sixty - two , yeah . professor b : uh , i 'm leaving next wednesday . may or may not be in in the morning . i leave in the afternoon . um , phd a : ah , ok , ok . professor b : and uh , that 's during eurospeech . phd a : so that 's you wo n't be at the next three of these meetings . is that right ? professor b : um mmm . { comment } so it 's just , uh , the next two where there will be there , you know , may as well be meetings , yeah . yeah . so . cool . </s>
<s> summarize the meeting </s> phd f : for you it is . professor c : but they were n't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good no , th there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you do n't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd f : so what we usually do is um , we typically will have our meetings professor c : session r phd d : r - nineteen ? phd f : i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c : mm - hmm . ok . why do n't you start with that ? that 's sort of phd f : we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c : how about an email that points to the faq , grad g : um , how do i do it with `` run command `` ? i mean do phd f : because um , you do n't wan na saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people grad g : oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f : well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines grad g : just do p - make . phd f : and and you basically write a make file that uh , you know your final job depends on these one thousand things , i can get some documentation . phd d : so it it 's it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f : it depends . if you `` run command `` , that i mentioned before , is does n't know about other things that you might be running . so , it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once , and they would n't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run professor c : so `` run command `` does n't use p - make , or ? phd f : well , if you have , um like , for example , uh if you did n't wan na write a p - make script and you just had a , uh an htk training job that you know is gon na take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say `` run command `` and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there . professor c : now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . professor c : um , what what about i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f : but yeah . i do n't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console tty , so maybe if you echoed something to the you know , dev dev console or something . professor c : i mean you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , `` screw this `` , phd a : uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f : especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a : so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . yeah that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . they 're going to give the endpoint information . phd f : i see . phd a : yeah , by fifty percent . professor c : ok . no , that 's that 's that 's a good good update . phd a : so , i 've been actually running some s so far i 've been trying it only on matlab . i have to to to test whether it works first or not professor c : s so you s you so you said one thing i want to jump on for a second . so so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is . cool . um , so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments . cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , i guess ? i i do n't know whether it was system one or system two , or ? so i let me let me just stop you there . so then , one distinction is that uh , you were taking the actual france telecom features and then applying something to and so one difference is that , i guess you were taking spectra . phd a : the speech . phd d : yeah . but i guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , phd a : because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech . i mean , if we are using our own code for th i mean that that could be the only difference . professor c : but you got some sort of different result . so i 'm trying to understand it . but uh , i th phd d : yeah , well i think we should uh , have a table with all the result because i do n't know i uh , i do n't exactly know what are your results ? but , phd a : ok . ok . phd d : mmm . yeah , but so we did this , and another difference i guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the lda filters , phd a : yeah , i assume . professor c : so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it . phd a : without any change . ok . phd b : the new . the new . phd a : i mean ok . phd d : so , um , i guess what will happen i do n't know what will happen . but , the different contribution , i think , for the different test set will be more even . phd a : yeah . but they d the everything i mean is like , but there that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . uh , no , i guess they are going ahead with the same weighting . yeah . so there 's nothing on professor c : i do n't understand that . phd a : usual . but this is natural recording . professor c : uh , it 's not guaranteed . phd a : yeah because the m the main major reason for the m professor c : so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th phd f : i see . phd a : so , it may not be really a big different . phd d : well , it gives something different , but i do n't know what are the , pros and cons of both . phd a : so we can that 's wh yeah . so , professor c : oh , oh , ok so the difference is the kl . phd a : so that that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve snr a little bit , first stage , phd d : yeah . uh , yeah . so there is this . and maybe we well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of vts techniques so it 's um , vector taylor series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . so . well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . and uh , there is a way to approximate this using uh , first - order or second - order taylor series and it can be used for uh , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . uh w working in the cepstral domain ? so there is one guy in grenada , phd a : this vts has been proposed by cmu ? phd b : yeah , yeah , yeah . originally the idea was from cmu . professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd a : i m i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that . guenter hirsch and ti . yeah . i 'm not sure about that . professor c : yeah . yeah , so that 'll be a little little task in itself . but we but we did n't do spectral subtraction . we were doing our funny stuff , right ? we were doing multi multi uh , multi - stream and and so forth . so . um , now we have this um , meeting data . you know , like the stuff we 're { comment } recording right now , uh , no training , from this , just just plain using the switchboard . phd f : i do n't not that i know of . professor c : but uh , yeah . but , you 're right that that that 's a real good point , that uh , we we do n't know yeah , uh , i mean , what if any of these ta i guess that 's why they 're pushing that in the uh in the evaluation . phd b : i do n't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , phd a : with what what other new p new parameter ? professor c : so maybe you probably need to back up a bit phd b : nuh . well . anyway . the first you have the sp the spectrum of the signal , and to to concat this new feature . but the result are n with the neural network i have more or less the same result . result . professor c : no the just the same same way we 're using i mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank . i mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good . but it 's different . and , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . and maybe , you know , using , orth you know , klt , or uh , um , adding probabilities , i mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . phd d : yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . professor c : part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not . you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . phd a : yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum , just the baseline . phd b : you did some experiment . phd d : hmm . well mm - hmm . but anyway the question is even more , is within speech , can we get some features ? are we drop dropping information that can might be useful within speech , professor c : talking cumulants or something ? cumulants or something . phd a : i do n't remember . and i 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or yeah . i mean , he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech , professor c : suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place ? phd a : not yet . uh , yesterday i called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . so . and she would get back to me on monday . so that 's that 's only thing i have and diane has a few more houses . she 's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back . so it 's that 's phd f : oh . so you 're not down here permanently yet ? phd a : yeah , i hope . professor c : they 're available , and they 'll be able to get you something , so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while phd a : yeah . so , in that case , i 'm going to be here on thirty - first definitely . professor c : until you ok . it 's a r root lpc , uh , of some sort . phd a : so you just professor c : to sort of ? but it but uh , you know . but what we 'd used to do w when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the lpc polynomial and and uh , finding the roots . it was n't plp cuz hynek had n't invented it yet , but it was just lpc , and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , and th when you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . phd f : so you just you typically just get a few roots ? you know , two or three , something like that ? grad e : which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . phd f : was n't a formant synthesizer was it ? professor c : but maybe he did n't have control over it or something ? grad e : in in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . and , um , w one thing that the , um , lpc approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that i i might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . um , stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order iir filter . professor c : i mean , that 's somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in , as as what you but but yeah , you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section , which has , uh , band center and band width , and um , um but . yeah . o k . so , uh , yeah , you 're going back today and then back in a week i guess , phd f : i guess we should do digits quickly . professor c : i almost forgot that . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about microphone issues </s> phd f : for you it is . professor c : there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you do n't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a : oh yeah . one . phd f : and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a : oh , ok . ok . ok . ok . professor c : r - nineteen . phd f : i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c : mm - hmm . ok . why do n't you start with that ? that 's sort of phd f : we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c : how about an email that points to the faq , you know what i 'm saying ? phd f : yeah , yeah . professor c : so that you can yeah . grad g : um , i have i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . grad g : um , how do i do it with `` run command `` ? i mean do phd f : you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g : uh - huh . a thousand times ? oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f : well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . professor c : um , what what about i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd a : uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure uh , yeah , after the submission the what i 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we did n't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . so so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh phd f : lda . ok . phd a : so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f : mm - hmm . phd a : what i did was i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after after that i i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that there there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i did n't i did n't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c : uh , can you back up a second , i i i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? or is it ? no you did n't , ok . phd a : but i did n't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . professor c : yeah . phd a : oh yeah so i just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement . the the other thing what i tried was the adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline and that itself gives like twenty - two percent because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech . and just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information , i just , uh , use yeah that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . they 're going to give the endpoint information . professor c : and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use . phd a : no . no . that i i yeah . yeah , yeah , exactly . i guess that is that is where the consensus is . like y you will you will you 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you . so that that the baseline itself i mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . i found that in s one of the speechdat - car cases , that like , the spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . w yeah , by fifty percent . phd d : mm - hmm . it was system one . so professor c : but you got some sort of different result . so i 'm trying to understand it . but uh , i th phd a : yeah , yeah . yeah . professor c : so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : yeah . but they d the everything i mean is like , but there that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . professor c : it seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . phd a : has has also some slight mismatches , unlike the ti - digits where it 's like prefectly matched phd f : perfect to match . professor c : so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th uh , so what else is going on ? phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . phd a : mm - hmm . ok . yeah . so . phd d : what was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a : and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . phd d : yeah . uh , yeah . so there is this . and maybe we well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of vts techniques so it 's um , vector taylor series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . so . well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . professor c : uh - huh . phd d : well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried . um , professor c : uh - huh . phd d : mmm , yeah . uh - huh . professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd a : yeah , yeah . professor c : sort of a sort of like what they did with ti - digits , and ? phd a : yeah . yeah . professor c : yeah , ok . phd a : i m i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that . guenter hirsch and ti . professor c : and then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating htk scripts to phd a : yeah . i 'm not sure about that . professor c : um , well we 've yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . but for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in broadcast news . so we we did the broadcast news evaluation and some of the focus conditions were noisy and and so . um , now we have this um , meeting data . you know , like the stuff we 're { comment } recording right now , um , but uh , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech , large vocabulary continuous speech , using switchboard uh , switchboard recognizer , phd a : ok . yeah . that 's cool . professor c : but we 're hop uh , actually uh , dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data . um , i mean , i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the sri recognizer and , uh , phd b : nuh . well . anyway . the first you have the sp the spectrum of the signal , and i do i did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature and to train a neural network to select it voice - unvoice - silence silence yeah . it 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd a : ok . ok . phd b : and if i do n't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . phd a : uh - huh . professor c : i mean we 've had these discussions before , and and one of the things that struck me was that uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information . and , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wan na suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units . um , but , you 'll do throw something away . and so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we should n't have . and um . so , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the fft that was going into the filter bank , i was thinking `` oh , ok , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . `` so that that 's interesting . maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features . but for me sort of the interesting thing was , `` well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? `` so another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the fft uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , phd a : voiced , unvoiced is like oh . or anything . professor c : no the just the same same way we 're using i mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . phd f : phones . phd a : oh , ok . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . professor c : part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not . you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . phd a : that is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the speechdat - car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the ti - digits . so , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . that 's it . mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . yeah . professor c : talking cumulants or something ? phd a : it wa it was taking the , um it was about finding the higher - order moments of yeah . yeah . i mean , he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech , professor c : yeah . grad g : um , so , um , i told you i was i was i was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam . so basically that 's just , um , trying to propose um , uh , your next your your following years of of your phd work , trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on . so , i 've been , uh , looking into , um , doing something about r uh , speech recognition using acoustic events . so , um , the idea is you have all these these different events , for example voicing , nasality , r - coloring , you know burst or noise , uh , frication , that kinda stuff , um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events , and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition . um , and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to larry saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events . and , um , so i i been i been thinking about that and some of the issues that i 've been running into are , um , exactly what what kind of acoustic events i need , what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . and , also , um , once i decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do i how do i get labels ? training data for for these acoustic events . and , then later on down the line , i can start playing with the the models themselves , the the primary detectors . um , so , um , i kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors i see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a um , gaussian mixtures hmm back - end , um , and doing recognition . um . so , that 's that 's just generally what i 've been looking at . phd a : yeah . professor c : by by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what carmen was looking at . grad g : yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as i think it is , it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced , grad g : mm - hmm . phd b : mm - hmm . grad g : yeah . yeah . um , were were you gon na say something ? phd a : not yet . uh , yesterday i called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . so . and she would get back to me on monday . so that 's that 's only thing i have and diane has a few more houses . she 's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back . so it 's that 's yeah . yeah . professor c : do y wan na say anything about you you actually been uh , last week you were doing this stuff with pierre , you were you were mentioning . is that that something worth talking about , or ? yeah . so it 's it 's it 's a little , uh formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , phd f : you know , two or three , professor c : and it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . grad e : which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . professor c : mostly they do . and and what i mean in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was ok </s>

phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . professor c : and you were n't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd f : uh , it seems like andreas did something for that . yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , so , um , but uh . phd a : yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure and uh , so , professor c : so it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , ok . no , that 's that 's that 's a good good update . i i do n't know whether it was system one or system two , or ? phd d : we the main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the france telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed . phd a : uh , no there is a slight different . uh i mean , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization professor c : yeah . but that 's what i mean . but u u sorry , phd a : yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . the speech . phd d : yeah . but i guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , right ? or ? yeah , well i think we should uh , have a table with all the result because i do n't know i uh , i do n't exactly know what are your results ? but , phd a : ok . ok . uh - huh . phd d : well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . in your case , if you tried just putting lda , then maybe on - line normalization ? mm - hmm . so we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was and , um , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . um , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . phd a : yeah , yeah . yeah . phd d : but , uh . phd a : yeah , i assume . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . because we change it the system to have phd a : i mean ok . phd d : yeah . lda filters . there are other things that we finally were shown to improve also like , the sixty - four hertz cut - off . phd a : yeah . so the the mm usual . uh - huh . professor c : the well wa matched has mismatch ? phd d : because it professor c : uh , it 's not guaranteed . phd a : yeah because the m the main major reason for the m professor c : so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th phd a : i guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on fft bins . phd f : i see . phd a : yeah . that 's what so i 've been thinking about combining the wiener filtering with signal subspace , phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . professor c : oh , ok . phd a : wiener filtering . it 's a it 's a cascade of two s phd d : what was your point about about colored noise there ?

<s> what did the professor say about the workshop ? </s> phd f : for you it is . professor c : but they were n't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good no , th there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you do n't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd f : and then at the end of the meetings we 'll read the digits . everybody goes around and reads the digits on the the bottom of their forms . professor c : if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f : i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . professor c : mm - hmm . ok . why do n't you start with that ? that 's sort of phd f : we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c : how about an email that points to the faq , you know what i 'm saying ? phd f : yeah , yeah . professor c : so that you can yeah . phd f : uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called `` run command `` . `` run dash command `` , `` run hyphen command `` . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say `` run dash command l s `` , and , um , it 'll actually export that ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um and that 's a simple way to get started using using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like `` run command `` , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . professor c : so as i understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines , phd f : yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i i sort of got started { comment } using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , `` uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . `` so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g : um , i have i have a question about the uh , parallelization ? phd f : mm - hmm . grad g : so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? phd f : mm - hmm . grad g : um , how do i do it with `` run command `` ? i mean do phd f : you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g : uh - huh . a thousand times ? oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f : well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : so `` run command `` does n't use p - make , or ? phd f : well , if you have , um like , for example , uh if you did n't wan na write a p - make script and you just had a , uh an htk training job that you know is gon na take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say `` run command `` and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there . professor c : now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . professor c : mm - hmm . phd f : but , the machines that do n't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , professor c : mm - hmm . phd f : they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job { comment } will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you do n't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , `` no evict `` , and it 'll pick a machine that it ca n't be evicted from . so . professor c : um , what what about i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd f : mm - hmm . professor c : and you were n't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd a : uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions phd f : he he knows that stuff better than i do . phd a : uh , yeah , after the submission the what i 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we did n't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . so so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . phd f : mm - hmm . phd a : what i did was i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after after that i i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that there there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i did n't i did n't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c : uh , can you back up a second , i i i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a : no . no , things did n't get better with the same time constant that we used . with the different time constant i found that i mean , i did n't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization , professor c : no you did n't , ok . phd a : but i did n't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . professor c : yeah . phd a : so , it 's still not yeah that 's , that 's what the feeling is like . they 're going to give the endpoint information . no . no . that i i yeah . yeah , yeah , exactly . i guess that is that is where the consensus is . like y you will you will you 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech but the whole speech is available to you . ye yeah , and i i came back and i started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm . i mean , so i from the submission what i found that people have tried spectral subtraction and wiener filtering . these are the main uh , approaches where people have tried , phd d : mm - hmm . it was system one . so professor c : so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something it seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th wiener filter . yeah , in general , you do n't that 's right you do n't wan na othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . actually . um , that was something that uh , herve and i were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy . phd d : what was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a : and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . huh ? uh - huh . phd d : uh - huh . yeah . uh , yeah . so there is this . and maybe we well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of vts techniques so it 's um , vector taylor series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . so . well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . professor c : uh - huh . phd d : well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried . um , professor c : uh - huh . phd d : mmm , yeah . mm - hmm . professor c : oh yeah . cuz hari 'll have his own ideas too or i guess not next week , phd d : uh - huh . professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : and then , you know , uh , but , w um , uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too . phd a : the other thing is to , uh most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . but we we going to address this wall street journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . so , there are some i mean , i was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction does n't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . and it 's always people have shown improvement with wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . but if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ . i m i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that . guenter hirsch and ti . professor c : and then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating htk scripts to phd a : yeah . i 'm not sure about that . professor c : yeah . yeah , so that 'll be a little little task in itself . um , well we 've yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . but for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in broadcast news . so we we did the broadcast news evaluation but we 're hop uh , actually uh , dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data . um , i mean , i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the sri recognizer and , uh , you 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the cpu or something trying to trying to do it , phd b : yeah . it 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . and no , i work with eh , italian and spanish basically . phd a : ok . ok . phd b : and if i do n't y use the neural network , and use directly the feature the results are worse . phd a : uh - huh . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : i mean we 've had these discussions before , and and one of the things that struck me was that uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information . and , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it , because we wan na suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units . um , but , you 'll do throw something away . and so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we should n't have . and um . so , when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the fft that was going into the filter bank , i was thinking `` oh , ok , so they 're picking on something they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . `` so that that 's interesting . maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features . but for me sort of the interesting thing was , `` well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? `` so another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the fft uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network , phd a : oh . or anything . professor c : no the just the same same way we 're using i mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mmm . professor c : but i i i have to tell you , i ca n't remember the conference , but , uh , i think it 's about ten years ago , i remember going to one of the speech conferences and and uh , i saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the fft and the fft did slightly better . so i mean the i i it 's true there 's lots of variability , so , um , uh , it - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in lda , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gon na be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . so , you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . talking cumulants or something ? phd a : it wa it was taking the , um it was about finding the higher - order moments of yeah . grad g : um , nothing i wan na really talk about . i can i can just uh , um , share a little bit sunil has n't has n't heard about uh , what i 've been doing . professor c : yeah . grad g : um , so , um , i told you i was i was i was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam . so basically that 's just , um , trying to propose um , uh , your next your your following years of of your phd work , trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on . so , i 've been , uh , looking into , um , doing something about r uh , speech recognition using acoustic events . so , um , the idea is you have all these these different events , for example voicing , nasality , r - coloring , you know burst or noise , uh , frication , that kinda stuff , um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events , and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition . um , and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to larry saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events . and , um , so i i been i been thinking about that and some of the issues that i 've been running into are , um , exactly what what kind of acoustic events i need , what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps . and , also , um , once i decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do i how do i get labels ? training data for for these acoustic events . and , then later on down the line , i can start playing with the the models themselves , the the primary detectors . um , so , um , i kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors i see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a um , gaussian mixtures hmm back - end , um , and doing recognition . um . so , that 's that 's just generally what i 've been looking at . phd a : yeah . professor c : by by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what carmen was looking at . grad g : yeah . phd d : mm - hmm . grad g : mm - hmm . phd b : mm - hmm . grad g : yeah . yeah . um , were were you gon na say something ? oh . it looked ok , never mind . um , yeah . and so , this this past week um , i 've been uh , looking a little bit into uh , traps um , and doing doing traps on on these e events too , just , um , seeing seeing if that 's possible . uh , and um , other than that , uh , i was kicked out of i - house for living there for four years . professor c : suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place ? phd a : not yet . uh , yesterday i called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . so . and she would get back to me on monday . so that 's that 's only thing i have and diane has a few more houses . she 's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back . so it 's that 's phd f : oh . so you 're not down here permanently yet ? phd a : yeah . yeah . professor c : do y wan na say anything about you you actually been uh , last week you were doing this stuff with pierre , you were you were mentioning . is that that something worth talking about , or ? it 's a r root lpc , uh , of some sort . phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : yeah . phd a : instead of the log you took the root square , i mean cubic root or something . what di w i did n't get that . professor c : no , no . it 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the lpc polynomial . so it 's like line spectral pairs . to sort of ? but it but uh , you know . but what we 'd used to do w when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the lpc polynomial and and uh , finding the roots . it was n't plp cuz hynek had n't invented it yet , but it was just lpc , and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , and th when you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . so it 's it 's it 's a little , uh formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , and it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . grad e : right . so , um , if @ @ { comment } every root that 's since it 's a real signal , the lpc polynomial 's gon na have real coefficients . so i think that means that every root that is not a real root { comment } is gon na be a c complex pair , which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . it was created from a synthesizer , and um in in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . and , um , w one thing that the , um , lpc approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that i i might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . um , stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order iir filter . </s>

professor c : r - nineteen . phd f : we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , there 's a c professor c : you know what i 'm saying ? grad g : um , how do i do it with `` run command `` ? i mean do phd f : you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g : uh - huh . a thousand times ? phd f : because um , you do n't wan na saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines grad g : just do p - make . s mm - hmm . right . ok . phd d : so it it 's it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f : and they would n't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run professor c : so `` run command `` does n't use p - make , or ? now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job { comment } will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you do n't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , `` no evict `` , and it 'll pick a machine that it ca n't be evicted from . so . professor c : um , what what about i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? and you were n't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? phd a : yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd f : are y are you saying lda ? phd a : so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . what i did was i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after after that i i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that there there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i did n't i did n't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c : uh , can you back up a second , i i i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a : but i did n't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . professor c : s so you s you so you said one thing i want to jump on for a second . so so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here cool . um , so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments . cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , i guess ? phd d : we the main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the france telecom , which provide us some speech samples that are uh , with noise removed . phd a : uh , no there is a slight different . uh i mean , which are extracted at the handset because they had another back - end blind equalization professor c : but u u sorry , phd d : yeah . but i guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , phd a : ok . ok . phd d : well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . in your case , if you tried just putting lda , then maybe on - line normalization ? mm - hmm . so we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was and , um , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . um , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . phd a : yeah , yeah . yeah . phd d : because if we keep the value that was submitted uh , it does n't help at all . you can remove on - line normalization , or put it , it does n't change anything . uh , uh , as long as you have the spectral subtraction . but , you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere , and we do n't know where exactly mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : without any change . ok . i mean ok . yeah . so the the mm professor c : because , um , you do n't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like , or it seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . phd a : has has also some slight mismatches , unlike the ti - digits where it 's like prefectly matched yeah because the m the main major reason for the m professor c : so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th phd a : yeah . that 's what professor c : well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing . phd a : that 's wh yeah . so , phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . professor c : oh , ok . oh , oh , ok so the difference is the kl . phd a : mm - hmm . ok . yeah . so . phd d : what was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a : and then make the noise white , phd d : and uh , there is a way to approximate this using uh , first - order or second - order taylor series and it can be used for uh , getting rid of the noise and the channel effect . uh w working in the cepstral domain ? so there is one guy in grenada , professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , sort of a sort of like what they did with ti - digits , and ? yeah , ok . um , well we 've yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . but for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in broadcast news . so we we did the broadcast news evaluation phd a : yeah . ok . ok . yeah . that 's cool . professor c : but we 're hop uh , actually uh , dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data . um , i mean , i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the sri recognizer and , uh , phd b : nuh . well . anyway . the first you have the sp the spectrum of the signal , phd a : mmm . ok . phd b : i do the difference yeah . it 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd a : ok . ok . professor c : no the just the same same way we 're using i mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank . phd d : yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . professor c : so , um , uh , it - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in lda , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gon na be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . so , you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . phd a : that is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the speechdat - car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the ti - digits . so , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . that 's it . phd d : wait i i 'm sorry ? phd a : mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . yeah . professor c : cumulants or something . phd a : it wa it was taking the , um it was about finding the higher - order moments of yeah . professor c : uh , anything on your end you want to talk about ? uh . grad g : um , nothing i wan na really talk about . i can i can just uh , um , share a little bit sunil has n't has n't heard about uh , what i 've been doing . professor c : they 're available , and they 'll be able to get you something , so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while until you ok . phd a : oh . ok . thanks . that sure is nice of you . so , it may be he needs more than me . professor c : do y wan na say anything about you you actually been uh , last week you were doing this stuff with pierre , you were you were mentioning . is that that something worth talking about , or ? it 's a r root lpc , uh , of some sort . phd a : so you just professor c : to sort of ? but it but uh , you know . but what we 'd used to do w when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the lpc polynomial and and uh , finding the roots . it was n't plp cuz hynek had n't invented it yet , but it was just lpc , and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , and th when you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . uh formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , phd f : you know , two or three , professor c : and it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . grad e : right . so , um , if @ @ { comment } every root that 's since it 's a real signal , the lpc polynomial 's gon na have real coefficients . so i think that means that every root that is not a real root { comment } is gon na be a c complex pair , um , of a complex value and its conjugate . um . so for each and if you look at that on the unit circle , um , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , i think . so i just so , um , f for the i 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and i 'll get three or four of these pairs which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . phd f : if this is synthetic speech ca n't you just get the formants directly ? i mean h how is the speech created ? grad e : in in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . and , um , w one thing that the , um , lpc approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that i i might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . um , stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order iir filter . professor c : but but yeah , you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section , which has , uh , band center and band width , and um , um but . yeah . o k . so , uh , yeah , you 're going back today and then back in a week i guess , i almost forgot that . </s>
<s> what did the team say about the person in grenada ? </s> professor c : uh , is it the twenty - fourth ? phd f : for you it is . phd a : uh - huh . professor c : but they were n't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good no , th phd a : uh - huh . professor c : there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you do n't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a : hello ? yeah . phd d : r - nineteen ? professor c : r - nineteen . if you say so . o k . do we have anything like an agenda ? what 's going on ? um . i guess um . so . one thing phd f : sunil 's here for the summer ? professor c : sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f : i could say a few words about um , some of the uh , compute stuff that 's happening around here , so that people in the group know . we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , professor c : how about an email that points to the faq , phd f : uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called `` run command `` . `` run dash command `` , `` run hyphen command `` . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say `` run dash command l s `` , and , um , it 'll actually export that ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um and that 's a simple way to get started using using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like `` run command `` , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . yeah . exactly . yeah , you know , i i sort of got started { comment } using the recognizer just recently and uh , uh i fired off a training job , and then i fired off a recognition job and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying , `` uh , are you running two trainings simultaneously s my m my jobs are not getting run . `` so i had to back off a little bit . but , soon as we get some more machines then uh then we 'll have more compute available . so , um , that 's just a quick update about what we 've got . so . grad g : so , um , let 's say i have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ? phd f : you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job grad g : oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f : well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f : yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . i can get some documentation . phd d : so it it 's it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f : and they would n't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run phd d : mm - hmm . professor c : so `` run command `` does n't use p - make , or ? phd f : well , if you have , um like , for example , uh if you did n't wan na write a p - make script and you just had a , uh an htk training job that you know is gon na take uh , six hours to run , and somebody 's using , uh , the machine you typically use , you can say `` run command `` and your htk thing and it 'll find another machine , the fastest currently available machine and and run your job there . professor c : now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . professor c : mm - hmm . phd f : but , the machines that do n't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , professor c : mm - hmm . phd f : they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job { comment } will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so which can cause you to lose time , right ?

phd f : mm - hmm . professor c : and you were n't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ? i mean you sort of you 're at home and you 're trying to log in , and it takes forever to even log you in , and you probably go , `` screw this `` , phd a : uh , i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here because i never d did anything so far with this x emissions uh , yeah , after the submission the what i 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we did n't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . so so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . professor c : uh , can you back up a second , i i i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? phd a : but i did n't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . professor c : and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use . phd a : ye yeah , and i i came back and i started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm . i mean , so i from the submission what i found that people have tried spectral subtraction and wiener filtering . these are the main uh , approaches where people have tried , so , i 've been actually running some s so far i 've been trying it only on matlab . i have to to to test whether it works first or not professor c : cool . um , so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments . cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week , i guess ? um , where you were also combining something both of you i guess were both combining something from the uh , french telecom system with the u uh phd a : the speech . professor c : but you got some sort of different result . so i 'm trying to understand it . but uh , i th phd d : mmm . yeah , but so we did this , and another difference i guess is that we just applied uh , proposal - one system after this without well , with our modification to reduce the delay of the the lda filters , professor c : so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : it seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . the well wa matched has mismatch ? phd f : perfect to match . phd d : yeah . well , so it means that if the database is large enough , it 's matched . professor c : uh , it 's not guaranteed . so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th uh , so what else is going on ? phd a : it i uh - huh . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . phd a : huh ? uh - huh . phd d : uh - huh . yeah . uh , yeah . so there is this . and maybe we well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of vts techniques so it 's um , vector taylor series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . so . well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . uh w working in the cepstral domain ? so there is one guy in grenada , phd b : yeah , in grenada one of my friend . phd d : and another in uh , lucent that i met at icassp . phd b : yeah , yeah , yeah . originally the idea was from cmu . professor c : uh - huh . phd d : well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried . um , professor c : uh - huh . phd d : mmm , yeah . mm - hmm . professor c : oh yeah . cuz hari 'll have his own ideas too or i guess not next week , phd d : uh - huh . professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : the other thing is to , uh most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks . but we we going to address this wall street journal in our next stage , which is also going to be a noisy task so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all . so , there are some i mean , i was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks and spectral subtraction does n't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks . and it 's always people have shown improvement with wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere . but if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ . i m i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that . guenter hirsch and ti . professor c : and then they 're they 're uh , uh , generating htk scripts to um , well we 've yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . but for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in broadcast news . so we we did the broadcast news evaluation but it , you know , we di stuff we did helped . i mean it , did something . phd a : ok . yeah . that 's cool . professor c : but we 're hop uh , actually uh , dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data . um , i mean , i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the sri recognizer and , uh , you 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the cpu or something trying to trying to do it , phd b : i do n't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , phd a : i 'm so sorry . i did n't get it . mmm . ok . phd b : yeah . it 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : mm - hmm . phd d : mm - hmm . mmm . professor c : but i i i have to tell you , i ca n't remember the conference , but , uh , i think it 's about ten years ago , i remember going to one of the speech conferences and and uh , i saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the fft and the fft did slightly better . so i mean the i i it 's true there 's lots of variability , phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : so , um , uh , it - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in lda , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gon na be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . so , you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . phd d : wait i i 'm sorry ? phd b : you did some experiment . professor c : talking cumulants or something ? cumulants or something . phd a : some small vocabulary tasks . grad g : um , nothing i wan na really talk about . i can i can just uh , um , share a little bit sunil has n't has n't heard about uh , what i 've been doing . yeah . yeah . um , were were you gon na say something ? oh . it looked ok , never mind . um , yeah . and so , this this past week um , i 've been uh , looking a little bit into uh , traps um , and doing doing traps on on these e events too , just , um , seeing seeing if that 's possible . uh , and um , other than that , uh , i was kicked out of i - house for living there for four years . professor c : oh no . so you live in a cardboard box in the street now grad g : in albany , yeah . yeah . and uh . yep . that 's it . professor c : suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place ? phd a : not yet . uh , yesterday i called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . so . and she would get back to me on monday . so that 's that 's only thing i have and diane has a few more houses . she 's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back . so it 's that 's phd f : oh . so you 're not down here permanently yet ? professor c : they 're available , and they 'll be able to get you something , so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while phd a : yeah . so , in that case , i 'm going to be here on thirty - first definitely . professor c : thanks dave . it 's a r root lpc , uh , of some sort . phd d : mm - hmm . phd a : instead of the log you took the root square , i mean cubic root or something . what di w i did n't get that . professor c : no , no . it 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the lpc polynomial . to sort of ? but it but uh , you know . but what we 'd used to do w when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the lpc polynomial and and uh , finding the roots . it was n't plp cuz hynek had n't invented it yet , but it was just lpc , and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , and th when you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . uh formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , phd f : so you just you typically just get a few roots ? professor c : and it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . grad e : which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . it was created from a synthesizer , and um </s>
<s> what did the professor think about the wiener filter ? </s> phd f : for you it is . professor c : yeah . we uh we abandoned the lapel because they sort of were not too not too hot , not too cold , they were you know , they were uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh and so forth but they were n't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good no , th they i mean they did n't wait a minute . i 'm saying that wrong . they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes , there 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you do n't get with the lapel uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel , but given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels . phd a : oh yeah . one . phd f : and then the channel number 's usually one less than that . phd a : oh , ok . ok . ok . ok . phd f : yeah . so you should be zero , actually . phd d : r - nineteen ? professor c : r - nineteen . sunil 's here for the summer , right . um , so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting maybe uh , and then just uh , i guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much . um . phd f : we um so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines , uh , to use as sort of a compute farm . and um , uh , we ordered uh , sun - blade - one - hundreds , and um , i 'm not sure exactly how long it 'll take for those to come in , but , uh , in addition , we 're running so the plan for using these is , uh , we 're running p - make and customs here and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh , fixed up and up to speed . and he 's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um , run things using p - make and customs . you do n't actually have to write p - make scripts and things like that . the simplest thing and i can send an email around or , maybe i should do an faq on the web site about it or something . um , there 's a c professor c : you know what i 'm saying ? so that you can yeah . phd f : uh , there 's a command , uh , that you can use called `` run command `` . `` run dash command `` , `` run hyphen command `` . and , if you say that and then some job that you want to execute , uh , it will find the fastest currently available machine , and export your job to that machine , and uh and run it there and it 'll duplicate your environment . so you can try this as a simple test with uh , the l s command . so you can say `` run dash command l s `` , and , um , it 'll actually export that ls command to some machine in the institute , and um , do an ls on your current directory . so , substitute ls for whatever command you want to run , and um and that 's a simple way to get started using using this . and , so , soon , when we get all the new machines up , um , e then we 'll have lots more compute to use . now th one of the nice things is that uh , each machine that 's part of the p - make and customs network has attributes associated with it . uh , attributes like how much memory the machine has , what its speed is , what its operating system , and when you use something like `` run command `` , you can specify those attributes for your program . for example if you only want your thing to run under linux , you can give it the linux attribute , and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that . so . you can control where your jobs go , to a certain extent , all the way down to an individual machine . each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself . so you can give that as an attribute and it 'll only run on that . if there 's already a job running , on some machine that you 're trying to select , your job will get queued up , and then when that resource , that machine becomes available , your job will get exported there . so , there 's a lot of nice features to it and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines and uh , right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it and we 're uh . the sri recognizer has all this p - make customs stuff built into it . grad g : um , how do i do it with `` run command `` ? i mean do phd f : you could write a script uh , which called run command on each sub - job because um , you do n't wan na saturate the network . uh , so , um , you know , you should you should probably not run more than , say ten jobs yourself at any one time , uh , just because then it would keep other people grad g : oh , too much file transfer and stuff . phd f : well it 's not that so much as that , you know , e with if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed , so it 's sort of a sharing thing . um , professor c : i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop , i remember one of the workshops i was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines and there was some kind of p - make like thing that sit sent things out . phd f : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . professor c : so all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine . phd f : yeah . yep . yeah , exactly . yeah , you have to be a little bit careful . phd d : so it it 's it 's not systematically queued . i mean all the jobs are running . if you launch twenty jobs , they are all running . alright . phd f : and they would n't know about each other . but if you use p - make , then , it knows about all the jobs that it has to run professor c : so `` run command `` does n't use p - make , or ? now , does it have the same sort of behavior as p - make , which is that , you know , if you run something on somebody 's machine and they come in and hit a key then it phd f : yes . yeah , there are um right . so some of the machines at the institute , um , have this attribute called `` no evict `` . and if you specify that , in in one of your attribute lines , then it 'll go to a machine which your job wo n't be evicted from . but , the machines that do n't have that attribute , if a job gets fired up on that , which could be somebody 's desktop machine , and and they were at lunch , they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console , then your machine will get evicted your job { comment } will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine . automatically . so which can cause you to lose time , right ? if you had a two hour job , and it got halfway through and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted . so . if you do n't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted , then you give it the minus the attribute , you know , `` no evict `` , and it 'll pick a machine that it ca n't be evicted from . so . professor c : um , what what about i remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work , but if you were logged into it from home ? phd a : yeah , yeah , yeah . yep . ok , sure phd f : especially with regard to the aurora stuff . phd a : uh , yeah , after the submission the what i 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions and then over their system , what they submitted , because we did n't have any speech enhancement system in in ours . so so i tried uh , and u first i tried just lda . and then i found that uh , i mean , if if i combine it with lda , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs . uh so , just just the lda filters . i just plug in i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in lda on top of that . but the lda filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal . what i did was i took the lda filter 's design using clean speech , uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band lda filter that we submitted uh , i got new filters . so that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system . slightly . but , not very significantly . and uh , that was uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an lda . and uh , so then after after that i i added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that . and that there there also i n i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one . but um , i did n't i did n't play with that time constant a lot , i just t g i just found that i have to reduce the value i mean , i have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value . that 's all i found so i have to . uh , yeah . and uh , uh , the other other thing what i tried was , i just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information , just the aurora baseline , to see that how much the baseline itself improves by just supplying the information of the i mean the w speech and nonspeech . and uh , i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh . professor c : uh , can you back up a second , i i i missed something , uh , i guess my mind wandered . ad - ad when you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ? no you did n't , ok . phd a : but i did n't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than . professor c : so it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better , phd a : so that that the baseline itself i mean , it improves by twenty - two percent . i found that in s one of the speechdat - car cases , that like , the spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint . w i mean you do n't need any further speech enhancement with fifty . so , uh , yeah , by fifty percent . professor c : i i do n't know whether it was system one or system two , or ? phd d : mm - hmm . it was system one . so yeah . but i guess it 's the s exactly the same thing because on the heads uh , handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features , phd a : ok . ok . phd d : well there are slight modifications , but it was the full proposal - one . in your case , if you tried just putting lda , then maybe on - line normalization ? mm - hmm . so we just tried directly to to just , keep the system as it was and , um , when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh , signif significantly . um , but , what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the on - line normalization . phd a : yeah , yeah . yeah . yeah , i assume . professor c : so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . phd a : yeah . but they d the everything i mean is like , but there that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on . professor c : because , um , you do n't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like , or it seems like something like the middle one is is more natural . phd a : has has also some slight mismatches , unlike the ti - digits where it 's like prefectly matched phd f : perfect to match . professor c : uh , it 's not guaranteed . phd a : yeah because the m the main major reason for the m professor c : so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok , so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car , and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something , and then i do n't think that 's very realistic , i mean i th phd a : so , it may not be really a big different . so i 've been thinking about combining the wiener filtering with signal subspace , phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah . yeah . professor c : oh , oh , ok so the difference is the kl . phd a : wiener filtering . it 's a it 's a cascade of two s professor c : wiener filter . yeah , in general , you do n't that 's right you do n't wan na othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy . actually . um , that was something that uh , herve and i were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff , that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy . phd a : mm - hmm . ok . yeah . so . so that that 's one reason maybe we could combine s some something to improve snr a little bit , first stage , and then do a something in the second stage which could take it further . phd d : what was your point about about colored noise there ? phd a : and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again . professor c : i was only half kidding . i mean if you sort of you do the s spectral subtraction , that also gets rid phd d : yeah . uh , yeah . so there is this . and maybe we well we find some people so that uh , agree to maybe work with us , and they have implementation of vts techniques so it 's um , vector taylor series that are used to mmm , uh f to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra . so . well , if you take the standard model of channel plus noise , uh , it 's it 's a nonlinear eh uh , transformation in the cepstral domain . well , it 's again a different thing that could be tried . um , mmm , yeah . professor c : week and a half , uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives , what we 've seen so far , and come up with some game plans . um . you know . so , i mean one way would he here are some alternate visions . i mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly , you pick on something that looks like it 's promising and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing . another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things , and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better , and then , you know , uh , but , w um , uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too . sort of a sort of like what they did with ti - digits , and ? yeah , ok . phd a : i m i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that . guenter hirsch and ti . yeah . i 'm not sure about that . professor c : um , well we 've yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too . but for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in broadcast news . so we we did the broadcast news evaluation phd a : ok . yeah . that 's cool . professor c : but we 're hop uh , actually uh , dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data . um , i mean , i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the sri recognizer and , uh , phd b : i do n't have good result , with the inc including the new parameters , phd a : mmm . ok . phd b : yeah . it 's neve e e sometime it 's worse , sometime it 's a little bit better , but not significantly . phd a : ok . ok . professor c : no the just the same same way we 're using i mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank . i mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good . but it 's different . and , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing . and maybe , you know , using , orth you know , klt , or uh , um , adding probabilities , i mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here . phd d : mm - hmm . mm - hmm . yeah , but there is so much variability in the power spectrum . professor c : but i i i have to tell you , i ca n't remember the conference , but , uh , i think it 's about ten years ago , i remember going to one of the speech conferences and and uh , i saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something , and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the fft and the fft did slightly better . so i mean the i i it 's true there 's lots of variability , so , um , uh , it - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in lda , and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gon na be the same in training and test , so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things , and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things . so , you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it , and let the but , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time , maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information . but , maybe the neural net and the h m ms could figure it out quicker than you . it 's just a thought . phd a : that is just a binary feature and that seems to be improving a lot on the speechdat - car where there is a lot of noise but not much on the ti - digits . so , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping . that 's it . mm - hmm . yeah , yeah . yeah . professor c : talking cumulants or something ? cumulants or something . phd a : and i 'm not sure about whether it is the higher - order moments , or grad g : um , nothing i wan na really talk about . i can i can just uh , um , share a little bit sunil has n't has n't heard about uh , what i 've been doing . professor c : by by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what carmen was looking at . you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as i think it is , it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced , phd a : not yet . uh , yesterday i called up a lady who ha who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth and she said she 's interviewing two more people . so . and she would get back to me on monday . so that 's that 's only thing i have and diane has a few more houses . she 's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back . so it 's that 's phd f : oh . so you 're not down here permanently yet ? phd a : oh . ok . thanks . that sure is nice of you . so , it may be he needs more than me . professor c : do y wan na say anything about you you actually been uh , last week you were doing this stuff with pierre , you were you were mentioning . is that that something worth talking about , or ? it 's a r root lpc , uh , of some sort . phd a : so you just instead of the log you took the root square , i mean cubic root or something . what di w i did n't get that . professor c : no , no . it 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the lpc polynomial . to sort of ? but it but uh , you know . but what we 'd used to do w when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the lpc polynomial and and uh , finding the roots . it was n't plp cuz hynek had n't invented it yet , but it was just lpc , and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial , and th when you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants , sometimes they 're not . so it 's it 's it 's a little , uh formant tracking with it can be a little tricky cuz you get these funny values in in real speech , and it depends on the order that you 're doing , but . grad e : right . so , um , if @ @ { comment } every root that 's since it 's a real signal , the lpc polynomial 's gon na have real coefficients . so i think that means that every root that is not a real root { comment } is gon na be a c complex pair , um , of a complex value and its conjugate . um . so for each and if you look at that on the unit circle , um , one of these one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency , one will be a negative frequency , i think . so i just so , um , f for the i 'm using an eighth - order polynomial and i 'll get three or four of these pairs which give me s which gives me three or four peak positions . professor c : yeah . so if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner . i mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like i say , funny little things that are do n't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well . but but uh , in your case um , you know grad e : it was created from a synthesizer , and um professor c : but maybe he did n't have control over it or something ? grad e : in in fact w we we could get , um , formant frequencies out of the synthesizer , as well . and , um , w one thing that the , um , lpc approach will hopefully give me in addition , um , is that i i might be able to find the b the bandwidths of these humps as well . um , stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a like a se second - order iir filter . </s>
<s> summarize the whole meeting . </s> industrial designer : mm-hmm so , ready ? sorry , i i um project manager : your judgement it 's is biased . so , we are user interface : where ? project manager : so let 's go for our detailed design meeting . industrial designer : yeah . project manager : so we 'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and in case if we 're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we 'll evaluate the um production . industrial designer : effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . user interface : product prod yep . okay . okay . so , this is our product or prototype . this is made by clay . it 's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . so this is a introduction of our product . next a mo yeah , so next slide . so there are several key features of our pr prototype . the first is that it is fuzzy . i 'm sure this would be the unique design the market . industrial designer : i do n't think i hope nobody will eat it you know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in marketing : yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . i mean there was fruits yeah . yeah . i do n't think it is . mm-hmm . industrial designer : i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . this , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . marketing : no , i mean , yeah yeah . inspira inspiration is true . project manager : next slide . user interface : uh , no this our only two slides . industrial designer : so what we w what i can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , user interface : so we cut it to see . project manager : mm-hmm . user interface : base . here ? marketing : but we say uh we sa we said solar . project manager : oh . do you think it wo n't be it wo n't cris increase the price ? we will have first to marketing : i mean , we gon na try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? industrial designer : the sha the bowl shape people like . marketing : yeah i mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . industrial designer : but it 's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . marketing : i dunno where the lemon is , but i mean it 's not obvious . industrial designer : because i i have no idea what marketing : first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . i mean the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . yeah bu but when you say technologically it 's more uh i dunno , in the core , or single . yeah , th that 's another really good point . maybe okay . industrial designer : i think technically it 's acceptable , so project manager : . you agree ? user interface : yeah , i agree . marketing : now maybe the most critical one . industrial designer : you just need the command . marketing : yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the yeah i 'm i 'm no i 'm not definitely convinced it 's it 's the best way to if you wan na jump from , i dunno , one to twenty ? yeah . i agree . i agree . industrial designer : yeah but y how you need to know i user interface : so change . yeah . so you got how many degree you you it project manager : yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go industrial designer : i think you can if you have a scale , so user interface : no no , you do n't have to y no it 's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , marketing : i do n't think so . project manager : just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? user interface : so it 's coarse to fine design . project manager : most of the time you have the yeah it 's a sleeping remote control . industrial designer : yeah , sleeping . marketing : so , which number ? project manager : do you agree ? user interface : yeah , agree , agree . industrial designer : four or three . maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . user interface : but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? marketing : mm-hmm . okay . but this this has to stay on the table , right ? yeah . you know tha that 's the weak point , industrial designer : yeah maybe , maybe may it need maybe some wo further work , but it 's marketing : target . project manager : so , th the project is accepted ? if you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . industrial designer : that 's the finance . project manager : okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . so as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we 'll have look to the final sh financial view . so the case . industrial designer : is sh it marketing : so we are all already nineteen . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . y y yeah , yeah . yeah , true . yeah , yeah . yeah . okay , yeah , yeah . scr project manager : i think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to marketing : no y i it did change , but industrial designer : fancy . user interface : we we can we can we c marketing : yeah , thi this might be . user interface : how about we change the sale ? industrial designer : double curve . we can transform the double curve into single c yeah . it 's it 's a bad idea , so . user interface : okay . okay . agree . project manager : so , yeah . it think we we 've done good job , as the cost is twelve fifty e user interface : could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? project manager : yeah , but it 's under or equal . it 's not written . sometimes it 's under or equal . user interface : okay . so let 's say project manager : twelve fifty . user interface : wha what project manager : yeah , i think . so i do n't think we need to redesign the p the product . industrial designer : so so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? marketing : well i think we have just have to discuss if project manager : so did you enjoy your clay modelling ? marketing : uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . industrial designer : yellow . i think you can think about a yellow tv now after a fruit tv or i dunno . user interface : yeah , but y you know the traditional tv it 's um project manager : squared ? user interface : could we come up with new tv with such as this kind of tv ? so you can you have base , triangle base so you the tv you can yeah . yeah . because the tv you also marketing : yeah , but just do n't trust too much the trends . industrial designer : the fruit ? yeah . marketing : 'cause fruit and vegetables it wo n't last for ten years uh . industrial designer : yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep marketing : tha that would that would make it . yeah . industrial designer : yeah , you can keep the global appearan project manager : yeah , and following so i think the costs are within the budget . we 're just at twelve fifty euros . industrial designer : yeah , the pr at project manager : do you think you can celebrate your creation ? user interface : and you can celebrate your leadership . industrial designer : uh it 's it 's a pr it 's like yeah . project manager : the thing now is to to sell it . industrial designer : right , go and sell it . goo and good luck , so user interface : yeah . okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve industrial designer : it should be it should be fine , you know , actually . s marketing : true . uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . still that was one of the requirements we had . it 's yeah but it i do n't think it 's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . industrial designer : uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r_ project manager : so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double r_ . so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , user interface : so we have to give a project manager : so we have the slogan too . marketing : yeah , but just flying saucer , or industrial designer : yeah . yeah i will try i 'll try . i can hel i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage user interface : okay . yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your tv traditional one ? yeah . so this one and this one . what do you choose ? industrial designer : it 's will enlight your house , your home and your tv , so . project manager : i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . industrial designer : yeah that 's that fine . so we can celebrate now . that 's our new product . marketing : we should celebrate . project manager : so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product . marketing : our final prototype which yeah . industrial designer : final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . project manager : final prototype , right . </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about product appearance . </s> industrial designer : sorry , i i um user interface : marketing : industrial designer : user interface : uh red it 's uh is more attractive . so we used two basic colour , yellow and red . and the shape , there 's two basic shape . the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . it 's we call it a mushroom design . project manager : user interface : it 's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . marketing : industrial designer : yeah . uh user interface : so this is a introduction of our product . project manager : genetically modified mushroom i will say , but keep on speaking . user interface : yeah , so next slide . so there are several key features of our pr prototype . the first is that it is fuzzy . i 'm sure this would be the unique design the market . industrial designer : yeah , yeah i 'm sure . project manager : maybe , i hope so . user interface : yeah , so it 's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . industrial designer : yeah , that 's true . user interface : so it 's quite convenient for user to use it . project manager : yeah , okay , but do n't touch do n't destroy your prototype . industrial designer : user interface : okay . uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it 's it 's um it 's unlikely you can not found it . so it 's v um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there 's some cute button . you c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so project manager : everything 's mushroom . so we can call our remote control the mushroom . user interface : yeah , everything 's mushroom . mush mushroom design , yeah . industrial designer : yeah but it 's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d to integrate , you know yeah . project manager : industrial designer : i do n't think i hope nobody will eat it you know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in marketing : yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . i mean there was fruits yeah . yeah . project manager : fruits and vegetables . industrial designer : really ? but fruit and vegetable , project manager : vegetables . mushroom is a vegetable . industrial designer : so mushroom was a kind of you know uh user interface : yeah . marketing : i do n't think it is . project manager : it 's vegetable . industrial designer : mushroom ? marketing : mm-hmm . industrial designer : oh , uh i 'm not sure . project manager : so th it 's something eatable . industrial designer : we can it 's a veg a kind of vegetable , i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . this , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . marketing : no , i mean , yeah yeah . inspira inspiration is project manager : industrial designer : and so user interface : uh , no this our only two slides . industrial designer : it is a low level chip , and project manager : mm-hmm . marketing : i mean , we gon na try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh yeah i mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . i dunno where the lemon is , but i dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or industrial designer : that 's great . project manager : and where is the voice recognition ? industrial designer : marketing : the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . yeah bu but when you say technologically it 's more uh i dunno , in the core , or single . user interface : marketing : yeah i 'm i 'm no i 'm not definitely convinced it 's it 's the best way to if you wan na jump from , i dunno , one to twenty ? yeah . i agree . i agree . industrial designer : i think something that yeah . user interface : yeah , yeah , yeah . you can do it . marketing : i do n't think so . industrial designer : yeah , it 's a bit difficult . i think b but the the vocal command is easy too . you can say fifty and fifty it 's okay , so marketing : yeah voc vocal command is okay . but w we 've said previously that maybe it 's not going to be th l the main industrial designer : uh , yeah , and y that 's yeah . project manager : but if you really want to to do zapping you you do n't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . user interface : project manager : just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? industrial designer : yeah . to see uh user interface : it 's like fine , from coarse to fine . industrial designer : yeah , yeah yeah . that 's user interface : so it 's coarse to fine design . industrial designer : that 's very technologic , so . yeah . project manager : most of the time you have the yeah it 's a sleeping remote control . marketing : so , which number ? user interface : yeah , agree , agree . i think it 's easier than traditional controller . if you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you do n't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . marketing : yeah . user interface : but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? industrial designer : and that 's marketing : yeah , if you 're changing your mind . fine to coarse . project manager : fine to coarse . industrial designer : yeah , b i think project manager : if you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . industrial designer : project manager : so uh mm mm . mm . industrial designer : mm . one maybe , yeah . marketing : project manager : pineapple bee . yeah , i think . user interface : yeah , i think it 's not t t project manager : yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . industrial designer : so so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? okay , okay , it 's fine . project manager : so did you enjoy your clay modelling ? industrial designer : user interface : yeah , it 's uh it 's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . project manager : marketing : uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . industrial designer : yep . marketing : 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . industrial designer : okay , okay . project manager : and new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . industrial designer : yellow . i think you can think about a yellow tv now after a fruit tv or i dunno . user interface : project manager : user interface : industrial designer : it can be an interesting i do n't know user interface : yeah the shape is very boring . could we come up with new tv with such as this kind of tv ? so you can you have base , triangle base so you the tv you can project manager : ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control . oh , that 's interesting . you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . electronic device . user interface : yeah . marketing : yeah , but just do n't trust too much the trends . industrial designer : the fruit ? yeah . marketing : 'cause fruit and vegetables it wo n't last for ten years uh . yeah , but this is good because it 's not a long long life product . industrial designer : we can think about tv with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . user interface : marketing : tha that would that would make it . yeah . industrial designer : the mood of persons , the fashions uh project manager : it 's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh tv with uh a a tr industrial designer : we int yeah , tv , yeah . a tv for autumn and a tv for winter , you know , so it 's marketing : user interface : industrial designer : so what i and do w is it okay . user interface : marketing : industrial designer : project manager : do you think you can celebrate your creation ?

so you can you have base , triangle base so you the tv you can project manager : ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control . oh , that 's interesting . you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . electronic device . industrial designer : device devi marketing : yeah , but this is good because it 's not a long long life product . industrial designer : we can think about tv with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . project manager : customable tv . marketing : yeah , yeah . project manager : ah such yeah . you 've already said mobile phones . user interface : okay . marketing : tha that would that would make it . yeah . project manager : yeah , and following industrial designer : the mood of persons , the fashions uh user interface : yeah . project manager : it 's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh tv with uh a a tr user interface : yeah . yeah . industrial designer : so what i and do w is it okay . project manager : do you think you can celebrate your creation ? industrial designer : uh it 's it 's a pr it 's like yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's party party remote control . industrial designer : i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so marketing : true . uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . industrial designer : i p is th y project manager : yeah , but the colour , i think the colour is more is most important , industrial designer : the the yellow ball thing that project manager : because i i do n't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double r_ . th no , it 's the it 's the pineapple control remote control . industrial designer : yeah i always lose my yeah , so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my tv , so it would be user interface : so you need to buy one . project manager : one thing i like is the shape , because you know it 's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . user interface : traditional one ? yeah . so this one and this one . what do you choose ? project manager : i prefer the laser remote control . no . user interface : what do you choose ? okay . industrial designer : it 's will enlight your house , your home and your tv , so . project manager : oh . maybe next if we decide to do something we 'd can put light inside . marketing : yeah but that 's going to be expensive , you know . project manager : i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . user interface : yeah . yeah . marketing : if it 's a new trend . okay . industrial designer : yeah that 's that fine . so we can celebrate now . that 's our new product . project manager : so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control </s>
<s> summarize the discussion about product evaluation . </s> industrial designer : sorry , i i um project manager : your judgement it 's is biased . so let 's go for our detailed design meeting . industrial designer : yeah . user interface : it 's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . industrial designer : yeah . uh project manager : genetically modified mushroom i will say , but user interface : yeah , so next slide . so there are several key features of our pr prototype . the first is that it is fuzzy . i 'm sure this would be the unique design the market . industrial designer : to integrate , you know yeah . i do n't think i hope nobody will eat it you know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in marketing : yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . i mean there was fruits yeah . yeah . project manager : fruits and vegetables . industrial designer : really ? but fruit and vegetable , project manager : vegetables . mushroom is a vegetable . industrial designer : so mushroom was a kind of you know uh marketing : i do n't think it is . industrial designer : mushroom ? we can it 's a veg a kind of vegetable , i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . this , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . marketing : no , i mean , yeah yeah . inspira inspiration is industrial designer : but it it 's might be okay , so . i it might be okay . so marketing : i mean , we gon na try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh so w we 'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , i think . one one being true , and seven being false . okay . do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? industrial designer : i think you have nice colours . i do n't marketing : uh i 'll agree it 's unique , but is it really industrial designer : is it really fancy ? user interface : so it depend on how d do you define fancy . marketing : yeah i mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . i dunno where the lemon is , but i mean it 's not obvious . user interface : uh so , my mush . project manager : looks like more fruit . maybe a pineapple ? industrial designer : that 's uh yeah , is that i have no idea what marketing : first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . industrial designer : if it is fancy or not . project manager : okay . is it better like that ? marketing : i mean project manager : let 's say it 's a pineapple now . marketing : i mean it 's project manager : it looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . marketing : right . so , from one to seven ? no , seven is false and one is true . industrial designer : i 'll give two or three . project manager : three , i will say three . industrial designer : three , it 's okay . three , three . three is fine for me . marketing : three ? project manager : is n't it bitter like that ? marketing : three . the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . industrial designer : is it easy to use ? marketing : yeah bu but when you say technologically it 's more uh i dunno , in the core , or single . yeah , th that 's another really good point . maybe okay . industrial designer : i think technically it 's acceptable , so project manager : maybe two ? two ? i would say two industrial designer : two , yeah , two . it 's it 's fine , so . most marketing : l last one w i would like to judge is is it easy to use ? how can you go directly to twenty , for example ? yeah . i agree . i agree . but i mean if you 're fro from two ? industrial designer : i think something that yeah . marketing : we 're not talking yeah . user interface : so you got how many degree you you it industrial designer : yeah uh project manager : seems to be good . industrial designer : on off , yeah . project manager : most of the time you have the yeah it 's a sleeping remote control . industrial designer : yeah , sleeping . marketing : ah , that 's not the ecological part , yeah . project manager : three . industrial designer : easy to use , it 's very relative but three it 's fine , i think , it 's reasonable three . project manager : three ? user interface : yeah , agree , agree . marketing : so reasonably , is four , is one ? industrial designer : three f three for me , it 's o it 's okay . marketing : so , three . industrial designer : four or three . maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . project manager : and what 's your opinion ? industrial designer : will you give four ? marketing : yeah , if you 're changing your mind . project manager : yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i 've lost the remote control . marketing : sure . yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . industrial designer : yeah maybe , maybe may four . maybe four , it 's okay . user interface : four . okay . project manager : four ? easy to use , four . gon na say four . marketing : four . industrial designer : yeah , four it 's more reasonable . yeah , four it 's more reasonable , so . so it 's nine , marketing : so , average ? industrial designer : nine over three . user interface : three ? marketing : three ? project manager : trois . three . marketing : yeah , especially on the easy to use industrial designer : yeah , b i think project manager : three ? industrial designer : mm . one maybe , yeah . one , you have . project manager : uh wood ? industrial designer : yeah , yeah . y y yeah , yeah . five ? user interface : five . industrial designer : yeah , true . yeah , yeah . yeah . okay , yeah , yeah . scr project manager : i think we s if we keep on adding things industrial designer : yeah , it was stage one , so . yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . marketing : yeah , one . project manager : pineapple bee . industrial designer : it 's it 's a bad idea , so . two ? user interface : yeah , i think it 's not t t project manager : yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . industrial designer : it 's easy to use . it 's very easy to use . so so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? marketing : next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . project manager : and new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . industrial designer : yellow . i think you can think about a yellow tv now after a fruit tv or i dunno . it can be an interesting i do n't know yeah , just a lemon tv it 'd be yellow lemon . user interface : could we come up with new tv with such as this kind of tv ? project manager : ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control . industrial designer : yeah , that 's that would be really interesting , actually . marketing : yeah , but just do n't trust too much the trends . industrial designer : the fruit ? yeah . but i think it 's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . marketing : yeah , but this is good because it 's not a long long life product . tha that would that would make it . yeah . industrial designer : the mood of persons , the fashions uh uh it 's it 's a pr it 's like yeah . user interface : yeah , it 's your job . industrial designer : yeah , right , go and sell it . goo and good luck , so marketing : yeah , i think it 's i 'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . industrial designer : it should be it should be fine , you know , actually . s project manager : maybe what you can do a test . put it outside , and if bees come , it 's really fruit . industrial designer : i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so marketing : no , the colours are uh it 's perfect , yeah . project manager : yeah , but the colour , i think the colour is more is most important , marketing : still that was one of the requirements we had . it 's yeah but it i do n't think it 's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . project manager : so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , user interface : so we have give him give it a cute name . project manager : th no , it 's the it 's the pineapple control remote control . marketing : cute na you can not say mushroom because it 's not the trend . project manager : it 's a pineapple now , it has changed . it 's a pineapple . with cherry on top . industrial designer : oh , that marketing : it 's more appropriate , somehow . industrial designer : that 's that 's pineapple remote control . i think it 's fine . project manager : will you buy one ? industrial designer : yeah . yeah i will try i 'll try project manager : try to . okay uh industrial designer : . i can hel i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage user interface : what do you choose ? okay . project manager : i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . marketing : if it 's a new trend . okay . industrial designer : it 's it 's fine . it 's i like it . next time . </s>
<s> why did the group think the design was technologically innovative ? </s> marketing : no not really just 'kay , so whe where is the remote control ? i do n't think it is . industrial designer : it is a low level chip , and you know wi the low level chips inside and you know the lcd button and the i the battery it is under . project manager : in the base . oh . do you think it wo n't be it wo n't cris increase the price ? industrial designer : but it it 's might be okay , so . i it might be okay . so project manager : so , mister money , what 's your opinion according to this remote control ? marketing : i mean , we gon na try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , industrial designer : so , four point three point five , it means it 's acceptable . marketing : uh i 'll agree it 's unique , but is it really industrial designer : but it 's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . project manager : maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that marketing : i dunno where the lemon is , but i mean it 's not obvious . industrial designer : because i marketing : i dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or industrial designer : that 's uh yeah , is that that 's a good idea . project manager : what 's the use for that ? user interface : uh , for turn turn the ball . if you want to turn the ball , it 's very it 's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . th this th th there 's two two functions . marketing : yeah , that 's wait th that 's the second point . project manager : is n't it bitter like that ? industrial designer : it 's a micro array , okay . project manager : and you can turn it so maybe it 's techno technologically innov innovative ? user interface : so you can capture voice yeah , you c industrial designer : and i think you you 've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is i w yeah , but project manager : we have tactile buttons . marketing : no , that 's good . yeah . yeah , th that 's another really good point . maybe okay . industrial designer : i think technically it 's acceptable , so user interface : yeah , it 's very easy . industrial designer : you just need the command . user interface : you can use this in this way . marketing : yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the user interface : th this is the base . so you can turn to change the channel . marketing : like if you want to go from industrial designer : if you hear some click project manager : i think it 's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . industrial designer : oh yeah , that 's difficult . that 's dif that 's difficult . user interface : it depend on the the angle you turn the marketing : yeah . i agree . i agree . industrial designer : yeah but y how you need to know i marketing : yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh user interface : then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you it 's it 's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the marketing : yeah voc vocal command is okay . but w we 've said previously that maybe it 's not going to be th l the main industrial designer : uh , yeah , and y that 's yeah . that 's very technologic , so . yeah . user interface : this is from one channel to project manager : most of the time you have the yeah it 's a sleeping remote control . marketing : ah , that 's not the ecological part , yeah . project manager : that 's true . w that why we have the solar ti yeah . user interface : yeah , agree , agree . i think it 's easier than traditional controller . if you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you do n't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . marketing : so you have user interface : the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? project manager : previously you said that turning this was the fine marketing : okay . but this this has to stay on the table , right ? user interface : i i this is just a base . you can just industrial designer : you can marketing : yeah but then uh when you turn turn it project manager : oh industrial designer : oh ye yes , that 's right . marketing : just it 's project manager : it 's just your turning from the base . you need to have everything in hand . if you want to turn , you ca n't use it and turn . marketing : yeah . you know tha that 's the weak point , project manager : yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i 've lost the remote control . user interface : so th this is a d next generation controller . yeah . industrial designer : yeah maybe , maybe may yeah , four it 's more reasonable . that 's the finance . project manager : and if not if it 's not the case y you would have to redesign it . so it has the energy source . we have hand dynamo . no , we do n't use that . we have battery , right ? so the case . yeah , but what what about case ? uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . i think it 's more like double curved . marketing : that 's gon na be double curved , yeah . industrial designer : double curve , yeah , double curve . marketing : yeah , yeah that 's special colours , sure . project manager : it it 's more like integrated scor . industrial designer : i think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . marketing : i think the price is okay . project manager : i think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to marketing : yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . user interface : we have to delete the the sample sensor , i think . project manager : yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , industrial designer : i think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . because uh it seems that this can be project manager : so , do we need special colour ? user interface : wait . marketing : black then is a regular colour , so . project manager : i think so we need if we try to have a kind of yeah . an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . and i think this is one . integrated scroll wheel push button marketing : yeah , thi this might be . industrial designer : one . i can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , i dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . double curve . we can transform the double curve into single c yeah . single curve should be fine , so . oh , what project manager : i think there 's a problem with the push push button . we only need maybe just one . marketing : so we have one button , project manager : so one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . twelve fifty e marketing : yeah y actually it 's wrong . we 're not under twelve euros and a half . okay . okay . user interface : okay . so let 's say project manager : twelve fifty . user interface : wha what industrial designer : yeah , to be able to si to sell it . marketing : that 's nice argument , industrial designer : it 's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . project manager : yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . marketing : yeah but we just have one button . project manager : so it 's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . marketing : easy . i do n't know about powerful . yeah . uh that 's what we 've just done . industrial designer : we 've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . project manager : yeah ? was it a nice way to create your remote control ? marketing : next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . industrial designer : okay , okay . user interface : yeah , but y you know the traditional tv it 's um could we come up with new tv with such as this kind of tv ? so you can you have base , triangle base so you the tv you can industrial designer : yeah , that 's that would be really interesting , actually . user interface : yeah . yeah . because the tv you also project manager : oh , that 's interesting . you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . electronic device . industrial designer : yeah , it 's marketing : yeah , but this is good because it 's not a long long life product . tv is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . that 's a yeah , yeah . yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep project manager : ah such yeah . you 've already said mobile phones . marketing : tha that would that would make it . yeah . project manager : yeah , and following industrial designer : yeah , the pr at uh it 's it 's a pr it 's like yeah . marketing : yeah . it 's party party remote control . project manager : the thing now is to to sell it . user interface : yeah . okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve project manager : it 's maybe a little bit expensive . user interface : no , it 's not so expensive . industrial designer : it should be it should be fine , you know , actually . s project manager : because i i do n't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . industrial designer : uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r_ project manager : so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double r_ . user interface : so we have to give a project manager : th no , it 's the it 's the pineapple control remote control . marketing : yeah , but just flying saucer , or industrial designer : oh , that yeah i always lose my yeah , so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my tv , so it would be user interface : what do you choose ? okay . industrial designer : it 's will enlight your house , your home and your tv , so . project manager : oh . maybe next if we decide to do something we 'd can put light inside . industrial designer : yeah . yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . marketing : yeah but that 's going to be expensive , you know . project manager : i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . </s>

<s> summarize the discussion about industrial design and quotation . </s> user interface : uh red it 's uh is more attractive . so we used two basic colour , yellow and red . and the shape , there 's two basic shape . the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . it 's we call it a mushroom design . it 's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . project manager : yeah , okay , but do n't touch do n't destroy your prototype . everything 's mushroom . so we can call our remote control the mushroom . industrial designer : yeah but it 's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d i do n't think i hope nobody will eat it you know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in marketing : i do n't think it is . industrial designer : we can it 's a veg a kind of vegetable , marketing : but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it 's fine . industrial designer : i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . this , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . it is a low level chip , and user interface : okay . so where 's the battery battery ? industrial designer : the battery it is under . marketing : but we say uh we sa we said solar . project manager : oh . do you think it wo n't be it wo n't cris increase the price ? so , mister money , what 's your opinion according to this remote control ? marketing : i mean , we gon na try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh industrial designer : so , four point three point five , it means it 's acceptable . marketing : uh i 'll agree it 's unique , but is it really industrial designer : but it 's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . marketing : i dunno where the lemon is , but project manager : it would be bet more like a lemon ? marketing : i dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or user interface : uh , for turn turn the ball . if you want to turn the ball , it 's very it 's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . th this th th there 's two two functions . marketing : yeah , that 's wait th that 's the second point . industrial designer : so we can we can say t it 's a micro array , okay . user interface : so you can capture voice yeah , you c industrial designer : and i think you you 've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is i marketing : yeah bu but when you say technologically it 's more uh i dunno , in the core , or single . industrial designer : you just need the command . marketing : yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the user interface : th this is the base . you just tu turn d d marketing : yeah i 'm i 'm no i 'm not definitely convinced it 's it 's the best way to if you wan na jump from , i dunno , one to twenty ? how can you go directly to twenty , for example ? user interface : it depend on the the angle you turn the industrial designer : yeah but y how you need to know i marketing : but i mean if you 're fro from two ? yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh user interface : y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . so you got how many degree you you it marketing : so you you count one degree , two degrees , no . industrial designer : i think b but the the vocal command is easy too . you can say fifty and fifty it 's okay , so marketing : yeah voc vocal command is okay . but w we 've said previously that maybe it 's not going to be th l the main project manager : yeah , but when you 're zapping you 're changing from one channel to the other , so you 're passing through all the channels . so , when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that 's you 've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . industrial designer : uh , yeah , and y that 's yeah . project manager : yeah , what 's what 's this cherry ? user interface : for this you can tune it 's for tune . you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . if you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . it 's like fine , from coarse to fine . yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . this is from one channel to project manager : most of the time you have the yeah it 's a sleeping remote control . that 's true . w that why we have the solar ti yeah . marketing : so , which number ? user interface : yeah , agree , agree . marketing : so reasonably , is four , is one ? industrial designer : three f three for me , it 's o it 's okay . four or three . maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . will you give four ? marketing : uh we would n't say , i mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . user interface : uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? i think it 's easier than traditional controller . if you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you do n't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . there 's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? project manager : previously you said that turning this was the fine marketing : yeah , if you 're changing your mind . okay . but this this has to stay on the table , right ? user interface : i i this is just a base . you can just project manager : it 's just your turning from the base . you need to have everything in hand . if you want to turn , you ca n't use it and turn . marketing : yeah . you know tha that 's the weak point , project manager : yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i 've lost the remote control . industrial designer : yeah , four it 's more reasonable . yeah , four it 's more reasonable , so . so it 's nine , that 's the finance . project manager : so it has the energy source . we have hand dynamo . no , we do n't use that . we have battery , right ? industrial designer : yeah , we have battery . project manager : um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? do you think one would be enough , or such as as number of branches ? industrial designer : uh i think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . three three solar cells . project manager : so , electronic . single simple chip on print ? just one would be necessary ? marketing : so we are all already nineteen . industrial designer : is yes a wooden pl i and that 's project manager : yeah , but what what about case ? uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . i think it 's more like double curved . marketing : that 's gon na be double curved , yeah . industrial designer : but it 's yeah , a a rubber uh project manager : y maybe , two ? we have two special colours . marketing : yeah , yeah that 's special colours , sure . yeah tha that 's wheel . project manager : yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . marketing : i think the price is okay . project manager : i think we s if we keep on adding things marketing : yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . user interface : we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . oh . project manager : yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , industrial designer : i think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . marketing : we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . black then is a regular colour , so . project manager : yeah . an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . and i think this is one . integrated scroll wheel push button industrial designer : one . i can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , i dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . double curve . we can transform the double curve into single c yeah . project manager : s uncurved . yeah , maybe not . industrial designer : single curve . project manager : maybe do n't bat no battery , only solar cells . marketing : so we have one button , industrial designer : one s one scroll wheel , so project manager : so one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . so , yeah . it think we we 've done good job , as the cost is twelve fifty e marketing : yeah y actually it 's wrong . we 're not under twelve euros and a half . project manager : yeah , but it 's under or equal . it 's not written . sometimes it 's under or equal . user interface : okay . so let 's say project manager : twelve fifty . industrial designer : it 's fine , twelve fifty uh the solar cells , r is i is it ? user interface : yeah , i think it 's not t t project manager : i think , yeah . but it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be so it 's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . marketing : next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . industrial designer : yellow . i think you can think about a yellow tv now after a fruit tv or i dunno . yeah , just a lemon tv it 'd be yellow lemon . user interface : yeah , but y you know the traditional tv it 's um yeah yeah it 's flat , could we come up with new tv with such as this kind of tv ? so you can you have base , triangle base so you the tv you can project manager : ah , the lemon tv with the pineapple remote control . industrial designer : the fruit ? yeah . yeah , it 's marketing : yeah , but this is good because it 's not a long long life product . tv is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . industrial designer : yeah , yeah . that 's a yeah , yeah . marketing : if you have a lemon lemon tv for industrial designer : we can think about tv with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . marketing : fifteen years project manager : customable tv . industrial designer : yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep project manager : ah such yeah . you 've already said mobile phones . marketing : tha that would that would make it . yeah . project manager : it 's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh tv with uh a a tr so i think the costs are within the budget . we 're just at twelve fifty euros . marketing : yeah . it 's party party remote control . project manager : the thing now is to to sell it . user interface : yeah . okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve marketing : uh-huh . twenty five euros . i 'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . project manager : yeah , but the colour , i think the colour is more is most important , because i i do n't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . industrial designer : uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r_ project manager : so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double r_ . th no , it 's the it 's the pineapple control remote control . marketing : yeah , but just flying saucer , or i would say flying saucer . user interface : twenty five euro . industrial designer : yeah i always lose my yeah , so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my tv , so it would be user interface : so you need to buy one . project manager : i prefer the laser remote control . no . user interface : what do you choose ? okay . project manager : oh . maybe next if we decide to do something we 'd can put light inside . marketing : yeah but that 's going to be expensive , you know . we had some problems going to twelve euros and uh i dunno . project manager : i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . marketing : if it 's a new trend . okay . </s>
<s> why did the group decide to keep the solar cells when discussing the industrial design ? </s> industrial designer : sorry , i i um i 'm afraid uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . marketing : 'kay , so whe where is the remote control ?

industrial designer : the battery it is under . project manager : and where is the solar solar cell ? marketing : but we say uh we sa we said solar . project manager : where is the solar cell ? industrial designer : in fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and project manager : oh . do you think it wo n't be it wo n't cris increase the price ? industrial designer : but it it 's might be okay , so . project manager : so , mister money , what 's your opinion according to this remote control ? marketing : we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , industrial designer : so , four point three point five , it means it 's acceptable . marketing : uh i 'll agree it 's unique , but is it really industrial designer : is it really fancy ? but it 's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . marketing : i dunno where the lemon is , but project manager : it would be bet more like a lemon ? what 's the use for that ? is n't it bitter like that ? feasible ? you said previously that you there 's um microphone inside an user interface : yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . industrial designer : it 's a micro array , okay . and i think you you 've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is i w yeah , but i think technically it 's acceptable , so project manager : it 's better like that , is n't it ?
