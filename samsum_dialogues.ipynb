      "tucker carlson exposes his own sexism on twitter ( updated )     tucker carlson has done some good work in the past … his site , the daily caller , is a frequent stop of mine and many other conservatives . they were responsible for exposing the journolist scandal , which highlighted the planning and coordination of many members of the left-wing press . i will always be grateful to tucker ’ s team for bringing that story to light . this is also why i am so angered by tucker ’ s recent actions . i thought he was better than this .     if you haven ’ t heard by now , monday evening , tucker carlson posted a disturbing tweet about governor palin which said :     palin ’ s popularity falling in iowa , but maintains lead to become supreme commander of milfistan     aside from tucker ’ s sheep-like response to warped poll numbers , he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment . he deleted the original ( which is why i had to link to a retweet ) obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong . unfortunately for him , many people had already seen it and responded . you can ’ t put the toothpaste back in the tube , tucker .     is this the sort of treatment that conservative women , who want to get involved in the process , are expected to put up with ? is it okay for male columnists ( conservative or otherwise ) to continue objectifying women in the world of politics ? no it ’ s not !     the best thing tucker carlson could do , is admit that what he tweeted was wrong , apologize to governor palin , and urge his fellow colleagues to be respectful with their language and written word . what he did was demeaning and offensive , and there is no place for it in conservative circles .     update : this is a poor attempt at an apology . tucker carlson tries to cover his tracks this morning by repeating the same mistakes he made last night . he wrote :     apparently charlie sheen got control of my twitter account last night while i was at dinner . apologies for his behavior .     he didn ’ t take responsibility for his comment and he fails horribly at humor . try again , and tucker … you ’ re not funny .     update ii : almost a day later , he finally apologizes :     i ’ m sorry for last night ’ s tweet . i meant absolutely no offense . not the first dumb thing i ’ ve said . hopefully the last .         story_separator_special_tag tweet with a location     you can add location information to your tweets , such as your city or precise location , from the web and via third-party applications . you always have the option to delete your tweet location history . learn more story_separator_special_tag i am not down with @karlrove @tuckercarlson misogynist mockery of @sarahpalinusa . sick of it . story_separator_special_tag on monday night , while the rest of the world was watching charlie sheen flame out live on cnn , tucker carlson took to twitter to make some impolitic statements of his own .     \" palin ' s popularity falling in iowa , but maintains lead to become supreme commander of milfistan , \" he wrote .     by the next morning , the tweet was deleted and he had apologized , writing , “apparently charlie sheen got control of my twitter account last night while i was at dinner . apologies for his behavior. ”     but that wasn ’ t enough to spare him the ire of conservative women on the blogosphere and twitter .     on tuesday , before carlson ’ s first apology , stacy drake , writing on conservatives4palin , praised carlson ’ s works at the daily caller , particularly the leaks of the journolist emails , saying that ’ s why his tweet stung so badly .     aside from tucker ’ s sheep-like response to warped poll numbers , he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment . he deleted the original ( which is why i had to link to a retweet ) obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong . unfortunately for him , many people had already seen it and responded . you can ’ t put the toothpaste back in the tube , tucker .         is this the sort of treatment that conservative women , who want to get involved in the process , are expected to put up with ? is it okay for male columnists ( conservative or otherwise ) to continue objectifying women in the world of politics ? no it ’ s not !         she was unimpressed with his first apology , and called for him to apologize to palin while continuing to denounce him for sexism on her twitter account .     michelle malkin joined the calls tuesday , tweeting : “i am not down with @karlrove @tuckercarlson misogynist mockery of @sarahpalinusa . sick of it. ”     later tuesday , carlson obliged : “i ’ m sorry for last night ’ s tweet . i meant absolutely no offense . not the first dumb thing i ’ ve said . hopefully the last. ”     some bros have come to carlson ' s aid . tuesday , erick erickson tweeted , \" maybe my sense of humor needs to be recalibrated , but when i heard @tuckercarlson ' s milfistan comment , i laughed then got out my passport . \"     ( needless to say , drake was not amused. )     but by wednesday , the thing had escalated into a full-blown war of the sexes within the conservative blogosphere , with whitney pitcher taking carlson ' s tweet as inspiration for her post on conservatives4palin : \" milf – misogynists ( and elites ) i ’ d like to fulminate . \"     perhaps an additional reason that governor palin does not win the respect of the elite and establishment is that you cannot be praised for your “perfectly creased pants ” if you often wear a skirt , right david brooks ? the continued line of attack from the establishment and elite men in the gop have come as a result of governor palin ’ s genetic makeup .     this post has been updated to correct the spelling of stacy drake ' s first name .\n",
